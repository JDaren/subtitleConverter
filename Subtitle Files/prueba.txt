1
0:0:27,160 --> 0:0:30,0
The Tesseract has awakened.

2
0:0:30,0 --> 0:0:30,955
The Tesseract has awakened.

3
0:0:31,760 --> 0:0:36,515
It is on a little world, a human world.

4
0:0:37,200 --> 0:0:40,397
They would wield its power,

5
0:0:40,760 --> 0:0:46,198
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.

6
0:0:47,680 --> 0:0:50,638
He is ready to lead

7
0:0:50,840 --> 0:0:56,39
and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

8
0:0:57,600 --> 0:0:59,875
A world will be his.

9
0:1:0,80 --> 0:1:3,72
The universe, yours.

10
0:1:3,280 --> 0:1:8,912
And the humans,
what can they do but burn?

11
0:1:22,560 --> 0:1:23,595
All personnel,

12
0:1:23,760 --> 0:1:25,955
the evacuation order
has been confirmed.

13
0:1:56,560 --> 0:1:57,959
How bad is it?

14
0:1:58,160 --> 0:2:1,311
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

15
0:2:4,760 --> 0:2:7,558
Dr Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

16
0:2:7,680 --> 0:2:9,477
NASA didn't authorise Selvig
to go to test phase.

17
0:2:9,680 --> 0:2:11,750
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

18
0:2:11,960 --> 0:2:12,915
Spontaneous event.

19
0:2:13,80 --> 0:2:14,149
It just turned itself on?

20
0:2:14,360 --> 0:2:15,349
Where are the energy levels now?

21
0:2:15,560 --> 0:2:17,630
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

22
0:2:17,840 --> 0:2:18,989
How long to get everyone out?

23
0:2:19,200 --> 0:2:20,474
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

24
0:2:20,680 --> 0:2:21,874
Do better.

25
0:2:22,800 --> 0:2:24,677
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

26
0:2:24,880 --> 0:2:26,199
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

27
0:2:26,400 --> 0:2:28,516
If we can't control
the Tesseract's energy,

28
0:2:28,720 --> 0:2:30,950
there may not be
a minimum safe distance.

29
0:2:31,80 --> 0:2:32,69
I need you to make sure

30
0:2:32,200 --> 0:2:33,792
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

31
0:2:33,960 --> 0:2:35,916
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

32
0:2:36,120 --> 0:2:37,758
Until such time as the world ends,

33
0:2:37,880 --> 0:2:39,836
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

34
0:2:40,760 --> 0:2:42,79
Clear out the tech below.

35
0:2:42,280 --> 0:2:44,669
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

36
0:2:44,880 --> 0:2:45,915
Yes, sir.

37
0:2:46,320 --> 0:2:47,435
With me.

38
0:2:50,400 --> 0:2:51,355
Talk to me, Doctor.

39
0:2:53,80 --> 0:2:54,399
Director.

40
0:2:54,600 --> 0:2:56,192
Is there anything we know for certain?

41
0:2:56,400 --> 0:2:58,550
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

42
0:2:58,760 --> 0:3:1,433
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

43
0:3:1,640 --> 0:3:4,996
The Tesseract is not only
active, she's behaving.

44
0:3:5,200 --> 0:3:6,155
I assume you pulled the plug.

45
0:3:6,360 --> 0:3:7,998
She's an energy source.

46
0:3:8,200 --> 0:3:11,112
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

47
0:3:11,320 --> 0:3:12,355
If she reaches peak level...

48
0:3:12,560 --> 0:3:15,836
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

49
0:3:16,40 --> 0:3:17,359
But we don't have the harness.

50
0:3:17,480 --> 0:3:18,708
My calculations are far from complete.

51
0:3:19,240 --> 0:3:21,674
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

52
0:3:21,880 --> 0:3:23,518
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

53
0:3:24,400 --> 0:3:26,152
That can be harmful.

54
0:3:26,360 --> 0:3:27,713
Where's Agent Barton?

55
0:3:27,880 --> 0:3:29,518
The Hawk?

56
0:3:30,360 --> 0:3:32,316
Up in his nest, as usual.

57
0:3:33,720 --> 0:3:35,438
Agent Barton, report.

58
0:3:36,280 --> 0:3:37,395
I gave you this detail

59
0:3:37,520 --> 0:3:39,33
so you could keep
a close eye on things.

60
0:3:39,240 --> 0:3:40,559
Well, I see better from a distance.

61
0:3:40,760 --> 0:3:42,637
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

62
0:3:43,80 --> 0:3:45,116
Doctor, it's spiking again.

63
0:3:45,320 --> 0:3:46,639
No one's come or gone.

64
0:3:46,840 --> 0:3:48,398
And Selvig's clean.

65
0:3:48,600 --> 0:3:50,795
No contacts, no IMs.

66
0:3:51,280 --> 0:3:52,998
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

67
0:3:54,840 --> 0:3:56,159
"At this end"?

68
0:3:56,360 --> 0:4:0,35
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to
the other end of space, right?

69
0:4:1,800 --> 0:4:3,28
Doors open from both sides.

70
0:4:3,760 --> 0:4:5,34
Not yet.

71
0:5:10,160 --> 0:5:13,152
Sir, please put down the spear.

72
0:5:50,880 --> 0:5:51,995
You have heart.

73
0:6:21,320 --> 0:6:22,753
Please don't.

74
0:6:24,480 --> 0:6:25,629
I still need that.

75
0:6:25,840 --> 0:6:27,239
This doesn't have to get any messier.

76
0:6:27,440 --> 0:6:28,589
Of course it does.

77
0:6:28,800 --> 0:6:30,597
I've come too far for anything else.

78
0:6:32,480 --> 0:6:35,153
I am Loki, of Asgard

79
0:6:35,840 --> 0:6:38,115
and I am burdened with
glorious purpose.

80
0:6:38,320 --> 0:6:39,673
Loki,

81
0:6:40,160 --> 0:6:41,388
brother of Thor.

82
0:6:41,600 --> 0:6:43,955
We have no quarrel with your people.

83
0:6:44,160 --> 0:6:46,993
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

84
0:6:47,560 --> 0:6:49,152
Are you planning to step on us?

85
0:6:49,480 --> 0:6:52,438
I come with glad tidings

86
0:6:53,640 --> 0:6:55,471
of a world made free.

87
0:6:55,840 --> 0:6:56,795
Free from what?

88
0:6:57,0 --> 0:6:58,274
Freedom.

89
0:6:58,800 --> 0:7:1,314
Freedom is life's great lie.

90
0:7:1,520 --> 0:7:4,796
Once you accept that, in your heart,

91
0:7:9,120 --> 0:7:10,917
you will know peace.

92
0:7:11,200 --> 0:7:13,555
Yeah, you say "peace,"

93
0:7:13,760 --> 0:7:15,512
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

94
0:7:15,720 --> 0:7:18,109
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

95
0:7:18,320 --> 0:7:19,594
This place is about to blow

96
0:7:19,720 --> 0:7:21,358
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

97
0:7:22,800 --> 0:7:23,789
He means to bury us.

98
0:7:24,0 --> 0:7:25,69
Like the pharaohs of old.

99
0:7:25,280 --> 0:7:27,157
He's right. The portal
is collapsing in on itself.

100
0:7:27,360 --> 0:7:29,476
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

101
0:7:29,840 --> 0:7:30,795
Well, then.

102
0:7:45,920 --> 0:7:46,955
I need these vehicles.

103
0:7:50,880 --> 0:7:52,916
- Who's that?
- They didn't tell me.

104
0:7:56,0 --> 0:7:57,194
Hill!

105
0:7:57,600 --> 0:7:58,828
Do you copy?

106
0:7:59,520 --> 0:8:0,794
Barton has turned.

107
0:8:13,320 --> 0:8:16,39
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

108
0:8:50,960 --> 0:8:53,76
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

109
0:9:8,880 --> 0:9:10,916
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.

110
0:10:39,120 --> 0:10:40,394
Director?

111
0:10:40,720 --> 0:10:42,153
Director Fury, do you copy?

112
0:10:42,360 --> 0:10:44,555
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

113
0:10:44,800 --> 0:10:47,109
I have men down. Hill?

114
0:10:47,440 --> 0:10:49,237
A lot of men still under.

115
0:10:49,440 --> 0:10:51,78
I don't know how many survivors.

116
0:10:51,280 --> 0:10:52,395
Sound a general call.

117
0:10:52,600 --> 0:10:54,238
I want every living soul
not working rescue

118
0:10:54,360 --> 0:10:55,315
looking for that briefcase.

119
0:10:55,520 --> 0:10:56,509
Roger that.

120
0:10:56,720 --> 0:10:59,871
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a Level Seven.

121
0:11:0,920 --> 0:11:2,433
As of right now,

122
0:11:2,640 --> 0:11:4,39
we are at war.

123
0:11:5,680 --> 0:11:6,908
What do we do?

124
0:11:42,280 --> 0:11:45,829
This is not how I wanted this evening
to go.

125
0:11:45,960 --> 0:11:47,518
I know how you wanted this evening
to go.

126
0:11:47,720 --> 0:11:48,755
Believe me

127
0:11:48,880 --> 0:11:49,869
this is better.

128
0:11:50,800 --> 0:11:52,597
Who are you working for?

129
0:11:52,960 --> 0:11:54,473
Lermentov, yes?

130
0:11:56,360 --> 0:11:57,759
Does he think

131
0:11:58,360 --> 0:12:0,78
we have to go through him

132
0:12:0,360 --> 0:12:1,759
to move our cargo?

133
0:12:2,960 --> 0:12:7,317
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

134
0:12:7,640 --> 0:12:9,517
Solohob

135
0:12:9,720 --> 0:12:11,676
a bagman, a front.

136
0:12:14,40 --> 0:12:18,33
Your outdated information betrays you.

137
0:12:19,560 --> 0:12:22,199
The famous Black Widow

138
0:12:23,800 --> 0:12:27,998
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

139
0:12:28,840 --> 0:12:31,877
You really think I'm pretty?

140
0:12:34,320 --> 0:12:36,470
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

141
0:12:36,760 --> 0:12:40,196
to move the tanks.

142
0:12:41,120 --> 0:12:43,634
Tell him he is out.

143
0:12:44,40 --> 0:12:45,598
Well...

144
0:12:48,360 --> 0:12:50,32
...you may have to write it down.

145
0:12:58,640 --> 0:13:0,39
It's for her.

146
0:13:3,360 --> 0:13:4,588
You listen carefully

147
0:13:4,720 --> 0:13:7,188
You're at 1- 14
Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.

148
0:13:7,440 --> 0:13:9,476
We have an F-22
exactly eight miles out.

149
0:13:10,320 --> 0:13:12,197
Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block

150
0:13:12,400 --> 0:13:14,356
before you can make the lobby.

151
0:13:20,560 --> 0:13:22,596
- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding? I'm working.

152
0:13:22,800 --> 0:13:24,28
This takes precedence.

153
0:13:24,240 --> 0:13:25,798
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

154
0:13:25,960 --> 0:13:27,678
This moron is giving me everything.

155
0:13:28,80 --> 0:13:30,594
I don't give everything.

156
0:13:31,960 --> 0:13:33,279
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

157
0:13:33,400 --> 0:13:34,355
Natasha...

158
0:13:35,880 --> 0:13:37,313
Barton's been compromised.

159
0:13:40,400 --> 0:13:42,152
Let me put you on hold.

160
0:14:22,200 --> 0:14:23,155
Where is Barton now?

161
0:14:23,320 --> 0:14:24,753
- We don't know.
- But he's alive?

162
0:14:24,960 --> 0:14:27,633
We think so. I'll brief you on
everything when you get back.

163
0:14:27,880 --> 0:14:29,836
But first, we need you to
talk to the big guy.

164
0:14:30,40 --> 0:14:32,998
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.

165
0:14:33,200 --> 0:14:36,556
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

166
0:15:0,280 --> 0:15:1,235
Who are you?

167
0:15:1,680 --> 0:15:2,715
Get out!

168
0:15:2,840 --> 0:15:5,229
There is sickness here!

169
0:15:5,360 --> 0:15:6,315
You're a doctor.

170
0:15:7,960 --> 0:15:9,188
My father's not waking up!

171
0:15:9,320 --> 0:15:11,72
He has a fever and he's moaning

172
0:15:11,200 --> 0:15:12,235
but his eyes won't open.

173
0:15:12,360 --> 0:15:13,315
Slow down.

174
0:15:14,800 --> 0:15:15,835
My father...

175
0:15:18,120 --> 0:15:19,75
Like them?

176
0:15:22,920 --> 0:15:24,114
Please.

177
0:15:50,200 --> 0:15:52,395
You should've got paid
up front, Banner.

178
0:15:52,600 --> 0:15:53,828
You know, for a man

179
0:15:53,960 --> 0:15:55,188
who's supposed to be avoiding stress

180
0:15:55,400 --> 0:15:58,517
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

181
0:16:0,200 --> 0:16:2,316
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

182
0:16:2,520 --> 0:16:4,909
Then what is it? Yoga?

183
0:16:6,40 --> 0:16:9,77
You brought me to the edge of
the city. Smart.

184
0:16:9,640 --> 0:16:13,519
I assume the whole place
is surrounded.

185
0:16:13,960 --> 0:16:15,279
Just you and me.

186
0:16:16,480 --> 0:16:18,436
And your actress buddy?

187
0:16:18,640 --> 0:16:20,517
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

188
0:16:20,920 --> 0:16:22,114
I did.

189
0:16:22,320 --> 0:16:23,309
Who are you?

190
0:16:23,520 --> 0:16:24,589
Natasha Romanoff.

191
0:16:27,800 --> 0:16:29,74
Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?

192
0:16:29,280 --> 0:16:31,874
Because that's not going to
work out for everyone.

193
0:16:32,80 --> 0:16:34,435
No, of course not. I'm here
on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

194
0:16:36,120 --> 0:16:37,553
S.H.I.E.L.D.

195
0:16:39,280 --> 0:16:40,235
How did they find me?

196
0:16:40,400 --> 0:16:41,958
We never lost you, Doctor.

197
0:16:42,160 --> 0:16:43,115
We've kept our distance.

198
0:16:43,320 --> 0:16:45,38
Even helped keep some other
interested parties

199
0:16:45,200 --> 0:16:46,189
off your scent.

200
0:16:46,680 --> 0:16:47,635
Why?

201
0:16:47,760 --> 0:16:50,35
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

202
0:16:50,240 --> 0:16:51,798
But now we need you to come in.

203
0:16:52,720 --> 0:16:54,517
What if I say no?

204
0:16:54,720 --> 0:16:56,756
I'll persuade you.

205
0:16:58,800 --> 0:17:2,952
And what if the other guy says no?

206
0:17:3,640 --> 0:17:5,198
You've been more than a year
without an incident.

207
0:17:5,400 --> 0:17:7,868
I don't think you want to
break that streak.

208
0:17:10,0 --> 0:17:12,514
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

209
0:17:13,520 --> 0:17:15,636
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

210
0:17:16,440 --> 0:17:19,432
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

211
0:17:19,760 --> 0:17:21,716
This

212
0:17:21,920 --> 0:17:24,195
is the Tesseract.

213
0:17:24,400 --> 0:17:27,73
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

214
0:17:29,800 --> 0:17:31,870
What does Fury want me to do,
swallow it?

215
0:17:32,80 --> 0:17:34,435
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

216
0:17:35,240 --> 0:17:39,233
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

217
0:17:39,440 --> 0:17:42,238
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

218
0:17:42,440 --> 0:17:45,113
If there was, that's where I'd be.

219
0:17:45,680 --> 0:17:47,750
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

220
0:17:47,960 --> 0:17:49,154
Not that he's told me.

221
0:17:49,360 --> 0:17:51,430
And he tells you everything?

222
0:17:52,80 --> 0:17:53,399
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

223
0:17:53,520 --> 0:17:54,509
He needs me in a cage?

224
0:17:54,640 --> 0:17:55,595
No one's going to put you in a...

225
0:17:55,760 --> 0:17:56,715
Stop lying to me!

226
0:18:0,760 --> 0:18:3,274
I'm sorry. That was mean.

227
0:18:4,200 --> 0:18:6,270
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

228
0:18:7,440 --> 0:18:10,273
Why don't we do this the easy way

229
0:18:10,480 --> 0:18:11,674
where you don't use that

230
0:18:11,880 --> 0:18:15,634
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

231
0:18:16,400 --> 0:18:17,628
Okay?

232
0:18:18,600 --> 0:18:19,874
Natasha?

233
0:18:25,320 --> 0:18:26,309
Stand down.

234
0:18:27,240 --> 0:18:28,719
We're good here.

235
0:18:30,480 --> 0:18:31,959
"Just you and me."

236
0:18:34,40 --> 0:18:36,508
This is out of line, Director.

237
0:18:36,720 --> 0:18:39,29
You're dealing
with forces you can't control.

238
0:18:39,440 --> 0:18:42,750
You ever been in a war,
Councilman? In a firefight?

239
0:18:42,960 --> 0:18:45,633
Did you feel
an overabundance of control?

240
0:18:45,840 --> 0:18:49,71
You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?

241
0:18:49,200 --> 0:18:51,714
Not Asgard. Loki.

242
0:18:51,920 --> 0:18:54,593
He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?

243
0:18:54,720 --> 0:18:55,709
His brother.

244
0:18:55,840 --> 0:18:57,796
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile

245
0:18:58,0 --> 0:18:58,955
but he's worlds away.

246
0:18:59,120 --> 0:19:0,838
We can't depend on him to help, either.

247
0:19:0,960 --> 0:19:1,915
It's up to us.

248
0:19:2,40 --> 0:19:4,554
Which is why you
should be focusing on Phase 2.

249
0:19:4,720 --> 0:19:5,948
It was designed for exactly this...

250
0:19:6,160 --> 0:19:9,197
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

251
0:19:9,440 --> 0:19:10,919
We need a response team.

252
0:19:11,120 --> 0:19:13,315
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

253
0:19:13,520 --> 0:19:15,238
This isn't about the Avengers.

254
0:19:15,440 --> 0:19:16,509
We've seen the list.

255
0:19:16,720 --> 0:19:18,836
You're running the world's greatest
covert security network

256
0:19:18,960 --> 0:19:20,518
and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race

257
0:19:20,680 --> 0:19:21,874
to a handful of freaks.

258
0:19:22,0 --> 0:19:23,831
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

259
0:19:24,40 --> 0:19:26,156
We need a response team.

260
0:19:26,400 --> 0:19:28,994
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even

261
0:19:29,200 --> 0:19:33,193
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

262
0:19:33,480 --> 0:19:34,708
You believe?

263
0:19:34,920 --> 0:19:38,356
War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

264
0:19:39,40 --> 0:19:42,237
No, it's won by soldiers.

265
0:20:1,80 --> 0:20:2,798
There's not enough time.

266
0:20:3,0 --> 0:20:4,479
I got to put her in the water!

267
0:20:9,640 --> 0:20:10,629
You won't be alone.

268
0:20:11,200 --> 0:20:12,633
Oh, my God.

269
0:20:13,80 --> 0:20:14,195
This guy is still alive!

270
0:20:37,960 --> 0:20:39,632
Trouble sleeping?

271
0:20:40,920 --> 0:20:43,480
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

272
0:20:44,960 --> 0:20:48,714
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

273
0:20:54,320 --> 0:20:57,39
When I went under,
the world was at war.

274
0:20:57,240 --> 0:20:58,992
I wake up, they say we won.

275
0:20:59,680 --> 0:21:1,159
They didn't say what we lost.

276
0:21:1,720 --> 0:21:3,950
We've made some mistakes
along the way.

277
0:21:4,360 --> 0:21:5,952
Some, very recently.

278
0:21:7,440 --> 0:21:8,589
Are you here with a mission, sir?

279
0:21:8,720 --> 0:21:9,675
I am.

280
0:21:9,800 --> 0:21:11,392
Trying to get me back in the world?

281
0:21:11,880 --> 0:21:13,472
Trying to save it.

282
0:21:17,960 --> 0:21:19,871
HYDRA's secret weapon.

283
0:21:20,80 --> 0:21:22,71
Howard Stark fished that
out of the ocean

284
0:21:22,200 --> 0:21:23,269
when he was looking for you.

285
0:21:23,800 --> 0:21:25,392
He thought what we think.

286
0:21:25,640 --> 0:21:29,599
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

287
0:21:30,40 --> 0:21:33,715
That's something
the world sorely needs.

288
0:21:35,160 --> 0:21:36,275
Who took it from you?

289
0:21:36,480 --> 0:21:37,833
He's called Loki.

290
0:21:38,40 --> 0:21:40,554
He's not from around here.

291
0:21:41,0 --> 0:21:42,991
There's a lot we'll have to
bring you up to speed on

292
0:21:43,120 --> 0:21:44,269
if you're in.

293
0:21:45,160 --> 0:21:47,116
The world has gotten even stranger

294
0:21:47,240 --> 0:21:48,275
than you already know.

295
0:21:48,760 --> 0:21:51,228
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

296
0:21:51,840 --> 0:21:53,432
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

297
0:21:55,120 --> 0:21:56,439
There's a debriefing packet

298
0:21:56,560 --> 0:21:58,835
waiting for you back at your apartment.

299
0:22:1,120 --> 0:22:2,951
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

300
0:22:3,80 --> 0:22:4,229
that we ought to know now?

301
0:22:4,520 --> 0:22:6,715
You should have left it in the ocean.

302
0:22:38,120 --> 0:22:40,873
Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.

303
0:22:41,80 --> 0:22:42,354
You disconnected
the transmission lines?

304
0:22:42,480 --> 0:22:43,435
Are we off the grid?

305
0:22:43,560 --> 0:22:45,630
Stark Tower is about to become
a beacon

306
0:22:45,800 --> 0:22:47,199
of self-sustaining clean energy.

307
0:22:47,320 --> 0:22:49,276
Well, assuming
the arc reactor takes over

308
0:22:49,400 --> 0:22:50,549
and it actually works.

309
0:22:50,920 --> 0:22:52,148
I assume.

310
0:22:52,640 --> 0:22:53,595
Light her up.

311
0:22:58,920 --> 0:22:59,875
How does it look?

312
0:23:0,40 --> 0:23:2,600
Like Christmas, but with more me.

313
0:23:2,800 --> 0:23:4,472
We've got to go wider on
the public awareness campaign.

314
0:23:4,680 --> 0:23:5,669
You need to do some press.

315
0:23:6,280 --> 0:23:7,235
I'm in DC tomorrow,

316
0:23:7,400 --> 0:23:8,833
I'm working on the zoning
for the next three buildings.

317
0:23:9,0 --> 0:23:11,116
Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?

318
0:23:11,320 --> 0:23:12,309
Enjoy the moment.

319
0:23:12,520 --> 0:23:13,635
Get in here and I will.

320
0:23:16,840 --> 0:23:19,638
Sir, Agent Coulson of
S.H.I.E.L.D. Is on the line.

321
0:23:20,200 --> 0:23:21,155
I'm not in.

322
0:23:21,800 --> 0:23:23,28
I'm actually out.

323
0:23:29,960 --> 0:23:32,474
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

324
0:23:32,680 --> 0:23:35,319
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

325
0:23:39,680 --> 0:23:42,513
Levels are holding steady, I think.

326
0:23:42,720 --> 0:23:44,790
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

327
0:23:45,0 --> 0:23:46,115
Which brings me to my next question.

328
0:23:46,280 --> 0:23:48,157
How does it feel to be a genius?

329
0:23:48,360 --> 0:23:50,510
Well, I really wouldn't know,
now would I?

330
0:23:50,720 --> 0:23:55,32
What do you mean?
All this came from you.

331
0:23:55,240 --> 0:23:58,710
No, all this came from that.

332
0:23:58,920 --> 0:24:1,115
Give yourself some credit. Please.

333
0:24:1,320 --> 0:24:3,38
Stark Tower is your baby.

334
0:24:3,240 --> 0:24:5,515
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

335
0:24:5,960 --> 0:24:7,29
12%?

336
0:24:7,160 --> 0:24:8,229
An argument can be made for 15.

337
0:24:8,360 --> 0:24:9,873
12%? My baby?

338
0:24:10,80 --> 0:24:11,593
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

339
0:24:11,720 --> 0:24:13,517
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

340
0:24:13,760 --> 0:24:15,910
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

341
0:24:16,40 --> 0:24:17,439
That was on you.

342
0:24:17,600 --> 0:24:19,591
- My private elevator...
- You mean our elevator?

343
0:24:19,800 --> 0:24:22,360
...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.

344
0:24:22,560 --> 0:24:24,790
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

345
0:24:25,0 --> 0:24:26,877
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

346
0:24:27,320 --> 0:24:28,469
It's not going to be that subtle.

347
0:24:28,680 --> 0:24:29,908
I'll tell you what.

348
0:24:30,120 --> 0:24:32,475
The next building is gonna
say "Potts" on the tower.

349
0:24:32,680 --> 0:24:33,999
On the lease.

350
0:24:34,880 --> 0:24:36,916
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

351
0:24:37,120 --> 0:24:38,314
Sir, the telephone.

352
0:24:38,520 --> 0:24:40,795
I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.

353
0:24:41,0 --> 0:24:42,877
Mr Stark, we need to talk.

354
0:24:43,160 --> 0:24:45,390
You have reached the life
model decoy of Tony Stark.

355
0:24:45,640 --> 0:24:47,517
- Please leave a message.
- This is urgent.

356
0:24:47,720 --> 0:24:49,438
Then leave it urgently.

357
0:24:50,920 --> 0:24:51,989
Security breach. It's on you.

358
0:24:52,200 --> 0:24:54,794
- Mr Stark.
- Phil! Come in.

359
0:24:54,960 --> 0:24:55,915
"Phil"?

360
0:24:56,40 --> 0:24:57,29
I can't stay.

361
0:24:57,240 --> 0:24:58,389
His first name is "Agent."

362
0:24:58,600 --> 0:25:0,158
Come on in. We're celebrating.

363
0:25:0,360 --> 0:25:2,78
Which is why he can't stay.

364
0:25:2,280 --> 0:25:4,157
We need you to look this over
as soon as possible.

365
0:25:4,360 --> 0:25:5,349
I don't like being handed things.

366
0:25:5,560 --> 0:25:6,959
That's fine, because
I love to be handed things.

367
0:25:7,160 --> 0:25:8,434
So, let's trade.

368
0:25:9,760 --> 0:25:11,193
Thank you.

369
0:25:12,360 --> 0:25:14,476
Official consulting hours
are between 8 and 5

370
0:25:14,600 --> 0:25:15,555
every other Thursday.

371
0:25:15,720 --> 0:25:16,675
This isn't a consultation.

372
0:25:16,800 --> 0:25:17,994
Is this about the Avengers?

373
0:25:18,400 --> 0:25:20,152
Which I know nothing about.

374
0:25:20,360 --> 0:25:22,794
The Avengers Initiative
was scrapped, I thought.

375
0:25:23,0 --> 0:25:24,319
And I didn't even qualify.

376
0:25:24,520 --> 0:25:25,475
I didn't know that either.

377
0:25:25,640 --> 0:25:28,393
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

378
0:25:28,520 --> 0:25:29,714
don't play well with others.

379
0:25:30,0 --> 0:25:30,955
That I did know.

380
0:25:31,80 --> 0:25:32,638
This isn't about personality
profiles any more.

381
0:25:32,800 --> 0:25:35,30
Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?

382
0:25:35,240 --> 0:25:36,195
Half a mo.

383
0:25:41,280 --> 0:25:43,510
You know, I thought we were
having a moment.

384
0:25:43,720 --> 0:25:45,233
I was having 12% of a moment.

385
0:25:46,400 --> 0:25:48,755
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

386
0:25:48,960 --> 0:25:50,837
How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?

387
0:25:51,40 --> 0:25:52,712
What is all this?

388
0:25:52,920 --> 0:25:54,399
This is

389
0:25:55,80 --> 0:25:56,35
this.

390
0:26:3,80 --> 0:26:4,399
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

391
0:26:4,520 --> 0:26:5,509
Tomorrow.

392
0:26:5,640 --> 0:26:7,835
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

393
0:26:8,40 --> 0:26:9,678
Well, what if I didn't?

394
0:26:10,280 --> 0:26:11,599
- Lf you didn't?
- Yeah.

395
0:26:11,800 --> 0:26:13,870
You mean when you've finished?

396
0:26:14,920 --> 0:26:18,71
Well, then...

397
0:26:23,80 --> 0:26:24,308
Square deal. Fly safe.

398
0:26:28,360 --> 0:26:29,429
Work hard.

399
0:26:32,200 --> 0:26:33,872
So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

400
0:26:34,80 --> 0:26:36,719
- I can drop you.
- Fantastic.

401
0:26:36,840 --> 0:26:37,795
I want to hear

402
0:26:37,920 --> 0:26:39,512
about the cellist. Is that still a thing?

403
0:26:39,720 --> 0:26:40,789
She moved back to Portland.

404
0:26:41,0 --> 0:26:43,992
What? Boo!

405
0:26:51,720 --> 0:26:54,29
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

406
0:26:57,600 --> 0:27:1,115
So, this Dr Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

407
0:27:1,320 --> 0:27:2,799
A lot of people were.

408
0:27:3,0 --> 0:27:4,558
You were the world's first superhero.

409
0:27:5,240 --> 0:27:7,834
Banner thought gamma radiation
might hold the key to unlocking

410
0:27:8,0 --> 0:27:9,274
Erskine's original formula.

411
0:27:10,280 --> 0:27:11,599
Didn't really go his way, did it?

412
0:27:12,0 --> 0:27:13,399
Not so much.

413
0:27:13,600 --> 0:27:16,319
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

414
0:27:18,280 --> 0:27:20,714
He's like a smart person.

415
0:27:22,760 --> 0:27:23,829
I gotta say,

416
0:27:24,160 --> 0:27:26,469
it's an honour to meet you officially.

417
0:27:27,200 --> 0:27:28,633
I've sort of met you. I mean,

418
0:27:28,800 --> 0:27:30,518
I watched you while you were sleeping.

419
0:27:32,280 --> 0:27:34,396
I mean, I was present

420
0:27:34,600 --> 0:27:37,751
while you were
unconscious from the ice.

421
0:27:37,960 --> 0:27:40,155
You know, it's really just a huge honour

422
0:27:40,280 --> 0:27:42,157
to have you on board this...

423
0:27:42,520 --> 0:27:44,317
I hope I'm the man for the job.

424
0:27:44,520 --> 0:27:47,273
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

425
0:27:47,480 --> 0:27:50,233
We made some modifications
to the uniform.

426
0:27:50,440 --> 0:27:51,873
I had a little design input.

427
0:27:52,80 --> 0:27:53,274
The uniform?

428
0:27:53,480 --> 0:27:55,869
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

429
0:27:57,0 --> 0:27:58,274
old-fashioned?

430
0:27:59,80 --> 0:28:1,150
With everything that's happening

431
0:28:1,360 --> 0:28:2,918
and the things that are about
to come to light,

432
0:28:3,760 --> 0:28:7,70
people might just need
a little old-fashioned.

433
0:28:38,280 --> 0:28:41,113
The Chitauri grow restless.

434
0:28:41,320 --> 0:28:42,958
Let them gird themselves.

435
0:28:43,80 --> 0:28:44,798
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

436
0:28:45,0 --> 0:28:46,115
Battle?

437
0:28:46,920 --> 0:28:49,878
Against the meagre might of Earth?

438
0:28:50,80 --> 0:28:52,799
Glorious, not lengthy.

439
0:28:53,0 --> 0:28:56,629
If your force
is as formidable as you claim.

440
0:28:56,840 --> 0:28:59,229
You question us?

441
0:28:59,440 --> 0:29:1,476
You question him,

442
0:29:1,640 --> 0:29:3,995
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

443
0:29:4,200 --> 0:29:6,998
Who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose

444
0:29:7,200 --> 0:29:9,953
when you were cast out, defeated?

445
0:29:10,160 --> 0:29:11,957
I was a king!

446
0:29:12,160 --> 0:29:14,276
The rightful king of Asgard,

447
0:29:14,760 --> 0:29:15,715
betrayed.

448
0:29:16,360 --> 0:29:18,874
Your ambition is little

449
0:29:19,80 --> 0:29:21,719
and born of childish need.

450
0:29:21,920 --> 0:29:23,831
We look beyond the Earth

451
0:29:24,40 --> 0:29:26,873
to the greater worlds
the Tesseract will unveil.

452
0:29:27,320 --> 0:29:28,673
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

453
0:29:31,360 --> 0:29:32,315
I don't threaten.

454
0:29:33,800 --> 0:29:36,268
But until I open the doors,

455
0:29:36,480 --> 0:29:39,950
until your force is mine to command,

456
0:29:40,680 --> 0:29:42,398
you are but words.

457
0:29:42,600 --> 0:29:46,388
You will have your war, Asgardian.

458
0:29:48,120 --> 0:29:50,31
If you fail,

459
0:29:51,0 --> 0:29:55,198
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

460
0:29:55,400 --> 0:29:59,598
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

461
0:29:59,800 --> 0:30:2,951
no crevice where he cannot find you.

462
0:30:4,480 --> 0:30:7,119
You think you know pain?

463
0:30:7,320 --> 0:30:12,758
He will make you long
for something sweet as pain.

464
0:30:40,760 --> 0:30:41,749
Stow the captain's gear.

465
0:30:41,880 --> 0:30:42,835
Yes, sir.

466
0:30:44,320 --> 0:30:47,312
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

467
0:30:47,520 --> 0:30:48,748
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

468
0:30:48,920 --> 0:30:49,875
They need you on the bridge.

469
0:30:50,0 --> 0:30:51,433
They're starting the face-trace.

470
0:30:51,640 --> 0:30:52,675
See you there.

471
0:30:54,360 --> 0:30:58,319
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

472
0:30:58,600 --> 0:31:1,68
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

473
0:31:1,280 --> 0:31:4,33
Did he ask you to sign
his Captain America trading cards yet?

474
0:31:4,240 --> 0:31:5,389
Trading cards?

475
0:31:5,600 --> 0:31:7,670
They're vintage. He's very proud.

476
0:31:9,360 --> 0:31:10,588
Dr Banner.

477
0:31:12,520 --> 0:31:13,748
Yeah, hi.

478
0:31:14,280 --> 0:31:15,429
They told me you would be coming.

479
0:31:15,640 --> 0:31:16,868
Word is, you can find the Cube.

480
0:31:17,880 --> 0:31:19,677
Is that the only word on me?

481
0:31:20,80 --> 0:31:21,195
Only word I care about.

482
0:31:23,680 --> 0:31:26,160
It must be strange for you, all of this.

483
0:31:26,840 --> 0:31:29,400
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

484
0:31:29,600 --> 0:31:32,68
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

485
0:31:32,280 --> 0:31:34,919
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

486
0:31:36,120 --> 0:31:37,599
Flight crew, secure the deck.

487
0:31:41,920 --> 0:31:43,433
Is this a submarine?

488
0:31:43,960 --> 0:31:44,915
Really?

489
0:31:45,40 --> 0:31:48,635
They want me in a submerged,
pressurised, metal container?

490
0:32:13,960 --> 0:32:16,235
No, no, this is much worse.

491
0:32:44,840 --> 0:32:47,434
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

492
0:32:47,640 --> 0:32:49,949
Increase collective to 8.0%.

493
0:32:54,840 --> 0:32:57,35
Preparing for maximum
performance takeoff.

494
0:32:57,160 --> 0:32:58,593
Increase output to capacity.

495
0:32:58,760 --> 0:33:0,796
Power plant performing at capacity.

496
0:33:1,0 --> 0:33:2,399
We are clear.

497
0:33:2,600 --> 0:33:4,33
All engines operating.

498
0:33:4,240 --> 0:33:8,677
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

499
0:33:8,920 --> 0:33:11,354
- We are at level, sir.
- Good.

500
0:33:11,720 --> 0:33:12,675
Let's vanish.

501
0:33:12,880 --> 0:33:15,189
Engage retro-reflection panels.

502
0:33:30,320 --> 0:33:31,435
Reflection panels engaged.

503
0:33:32,40 --> 0:33:33,359
Gentlemen.

504
0:33:45,200 --> 0:33:46,269
Doctor, thank you for coming.

505
0:33:48,200 --> 0:33:49,997
Thanks for asking nicely.

506
0:33:50,200 --> 0:33:52,714
So, how long am I staying?

507
0:33:52,920 --> 0:33:54,638
Once we get our hands on
the Tesseract,

508
0:33:54,760 --> 0:33:55,909
you're in the wind.

509
0:33:56,40 --> 0:33:57,792
Where are you with that?

510
0:33:58,0 --> 0:33:59,672
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible

511
0:33:59,800 --> 0:34:0,755
camera on the planet.

512
0:34:1,320 --> 0:34:3,38
Cell phones, laptops...

513
0:34:3,560 --> 0:34:6,711
If it's connected to a satellite,
it's eyes and ears for us.

514
0:34:6,920 --> 0:34:8,114
That's still not gonna find them in time.

515
0:34:8,320 --> 0:34:9,275
You have to narrow your field.

516
0:34:9,480 --> 0:34:11,357
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

517
0:34:11,560 --> 0:34:13,118
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know.

518
0:34:13,320 --> 0:34:14,958
Tell them to put
the spectrometers on the roof

519
0:34:15,80 --> 0:34:16,479
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

520
0:34:16,680 --> 0:34:19,752
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

521
0:34:20,40 --> 0:34:22,349
At least we could rule out a few places.

522
0:34:22,600 --> 0:34:24,318
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

523
0:34:24,560 --> 0:34:25,629
Agent Romanoff,

524
0:34:25,800 --> 0:34:27,950
could you show Dr Banner
to his laboratory, please?

525
0:34:29,40 --> 0:34:31,190
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

526
0:34:31,720 --> 0:34:33,438
Put it over there.

527
0:34:35,360 --> 0:34:37,396
Where did you find all these people?

528
0:34:37,600 --> 0:34:40,433
S.H.I.E.L.D. Has no shortage
of enemies, Doctor.

529
0:34:40,880 --> 0:34:41,915
Is this the stuff you need?

530
0:34:42,80 --> 0:34:43,35
Yeah, iridium.

531
0:34:43,200 --> 0:34:45,714
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

532
0:34:45,920 --> 0:34:47,478
It's very hard to get hold of.

533
0:34:47,680 --> 0:34:49,159
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
Knows you need it.

534
0:34:49,360 --> 0:34:50,679
Well, I didn't know.

535
0:34:50,880 --> 0:34:52,29
Hey!

536
0:34:52,240 --> 0:34:54,435
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

537
0:34:54,880 --> 0:34:56,711
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

538
0:34:56,840 --> 0:34:57,795
I know.

539
0:34:58,600 --> 0:35:0,431
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

540
0:35:1,360 --> 0:35:2,713
My next target.

541
0:35:2,880 --> 0:35:3,835
Tell me what you need.

542
0:35:7,200 --> 0:35:8,952
I need a distraction.

543
0:35:9,840 --> 0:35:11,193
And an eyeball.

544
0:35:17,680 --> 0:35:20,114
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

545
0:35:20,320 --> 0:35:21,309
No, no. It's fine.

546
0:35:24,240 --> 0:35:25,753
It's a vintage set.

547
0:35:25,960 --> 0:35:28,155
It took me a couple of years
to collect them all.

548
0:35:30,600 --> 0:35:31,635
Near mint.

549
0:35:31,840 --> 0:35:33,159
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

550
0:35:33,360 --> 0:35:35,874
We got a hit. A 67% match.

551
0:35:36,360 --> 0:35:37,918
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

552
0:35:38,880 --> 0:35:39,835
Location?

553
0:35:40,0 --> 0:35:42,912
Stuttgart, Germany. 28 Königstrasse.

554
0:35:43,120 --> 0:35:44,314
He's not exactly hiding.

555
0:35:44,520 --> 0:35:45,589
Captain,

556
0:35:45,920 --> 0:35:46,875
you're up.

557
0:38:16,40 --> 0:38:17,109
Kneel before me.

558
0:38:21,400 --> 0:38:22,628
I said

559
0:38:24,640 --> 0:38:26,710
kneel!

560
0:38:35,640 --> 0:38:38,871
Is not this simpler?

561
0:38:40,360 --> 0:38:43,432
Is this not your natural state?

562
0:38:45,640 --> 0:38:48,712
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

563
0:38:48,920 --> 0:38:51,195
that you crave subjugation.

564
0:38:51,720 --> 0:38:55,349
The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy

565
0:38:55,560 --> 0:38:58,28
in a mad scramble for power,

566
0:38:59,800 --> 0:39:1,119
for identity.

567
0:39:2,720 --> 0:39:5,917
You were made to be ruled.

568
0:39:6,520 --> 0:39:8,78
In the end,

569
0:39:8,320 --> 0:39:10,515
you will always kneel.

570
0:39:17,600 --> 0:39:19,477
Not to men like you.

571
0:39:20,480 --> 0:39:22,311
There are no men like me.

572
0:39:23,160 --> 0:39:25,913
There are always men like you.

573
0:39:27,160 --> 0:39:28,912
Look to your elder, people.

574
0:39:31,40 --> 0:39:32,393
Let him be an example.

575
0:39:38,920 --> 0:39:41,388
You know, the last time
I was in Germany,

576
0:39:41,600 --> 0:39:44,637
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

577
0:39:44,840 --> 0:39:46,239
we ended up disagreeing.

578
0:39:46,440 --> 0:39:48,317
The soldier.

579
0:39:50,280 --> 0:39:51,474
The man out of time.

580
0:39:52,40 --> 0:39:53,234
I'm not the one who's out of time.

581
0:39:56,600 --> 0:39:59,34
Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.

582
0:40:18,560 --> 0:40:20,73
Kneel.

583
0:40:20,200 --> 0:40:21,553
Not today!

584
0:40:23,560 --> 0:40:24,788
The guy's all over the place.

585
0:40:28,160 --> 0:40:30,390
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?

586
0:40:46,440 --> 0:40:47,840
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

587
0:40:47,840 --> 0:40:48,431
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

588
0:40:56,160 --> 0:40:57,559
Good move.

589
0:40:59,0 --> 0:41:0,228
Mr Stark.

590
0:41:0,880 --> 0:41:1,995
Captain.

591
0:41:8,920 --> 0:41:10,478
Is he saying anything?

592
0:41:10,680 --> 0:41:11,874
Not a word.

593
0:41:12,160 --> 0:41:13,991
Just get him here. We're low on time.

594
0:41:16,920 --> 0:41:17,875
I don't like it.

595
0:41:18,240 --> 0:41:20,117
What, Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

596
0:41:20,320 --> 0:41:21,912
I don't remember it being that easy.

597
0:41:22,80 --> 0:41:23,479
This guy packs a wallop.

598
0:41:23,680 --> 0:41:27,116
Still, you are pretty spry
for an older fellow.

599
0:41:28,120 --> 0:41:29,633
What's your thing, Pilates?

600
0:41:29,800 --> 0:41:30,755
What?

601
0:41:30,920 --> 0:41:31,875
It's like calisthenics.

602
0:41:32,0 --> 0:41:33,956
You might have missed
a couple of things

603
0:41:34,160 --> 0:41:35,718
doing time as a Capsicle.

604
0:41:37,560 --> 0:41:39,73
Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

605
0:41:39,280 --> 0:41:42,33
Yeah, there's a lot of things
Fury doesn't tell you.

606
0:41:42,400 --> 0:41:43,913
Where's this coming from?

607
0:41:47,840 --> 0:41:50,308
What's the matter? Are you
scared of a little lightning?

608
0:41:50,720 --> 0:41:52,915
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

609
0:42:10,0 --> 0:42:11,115
What are you doing?

610
0:42:23,520 --> 0:42:24,919
And now there's that guy.

611
0:42:25,120 --> 0:42:26,792
Another Asgardian?

612
0:42:27,0 --> 0:42:28,752
- That guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.

613
0:42:28,960 --> 0:42:31,428
If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.

614
0:42:31,640 --> 0:42:33,392
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

615
0:42:33,600 --> 0:42:35,795
I have a plan. Attack.

616
0:42:41,560 --> 0:42:43,278
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

617
0:42:43,480 --> 0:42:44,435
I don't see how I can.

618
0:42:44,640 --> 0:42:47,154
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

619
0:42:47,600 --> 0:42:48,828
There's only one God, ma'am.

620
0:42:48,960 --> 0:42:51,235
And I'm pretty sure
he doesn't dress like that.

621
0:43:6,80 --> 0:43:7,399
Where is the Tesseract?

622
0:43:7,600 --> 0:43:8,828
I missed you, too.

623
0:43:9,40 --> 0:43:10,640
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

624
0:43:11,320 --> 0:43:12,639
You should thank me.

625
0:43:13,80 --> 0:43:15,36
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

626
0:43:15,240 --> 0:43:17,879
did the Allfather have to
muster to conjure you here

627
0:43:18,80 --> 0:43:19,399
to your precious Earth?

628
0:43:23,360 --> 0:43:24,588
I thought you dead.

629
0:43:26,160 --> 0:43:27,513
Did you mourn?

630
0:43:27,960 --> 0:43:29,678
We all did. Our father...

631
0:43:30,0 --> 0:43:32,798
Your father.

632
0:43:34,600 --> 0:43:37,353
He did tell you
my true parentage, did he not?

633
0:43:39,800 --> 0:43:41,950
We were raised together.

634
0:43:42,160 --> 0:43:44,674
We played together,
we fought together.

635
0:43:45,160 --> 0:43:46,309
Do you remember none of that?

636
0:43:46,520 --> 0:43:48,397
I remember a shadow.

637
0:43:49,840 --> 0:43:52,752
Living in the shade of your greatness.

638
0:43:53,440 --> 0:43:55,954
I remember you tossing me
into an abyss.

639
0:43:56,80 --> 0:43:57,991
I, who was, and should be, king!

640
0:43:58,200 --> 0:44:0,191
So you take the world I love
as a recompense

641
0:44:0,320 --> 0:44:2,72
for your imagined slights?

642
0:44:2,280 --> 0:44:5,238
No. The Earth is under
my protection, Loki.

643
0:44:6,600 --> 0:44:9,990
And you're doing
a marvellous job with that.

644
0:44:10,440 --> 0:44:12,317
The humans slaughter
each other in droves

645
0:44:12,440 --> 0:44:14,158
while you idly fret.

646
0:44:14,360 --> 0:44:16,430
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

647
0:44:16,640 --> 0:44:18,119
You think yourself above them?

648
0:44:19,160 --> 0:44:20,115
Well, yes.

649
0:44:20,320 --> 0:44:22,675
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

650
0:44:23,480 --> 0:44:24,799
A throne would suit you ill.

651
0:44:29,800 --> 0:44:32,439
I've seen worlds
you've never known about!

652
0:44:32,640 --> 0:44:36,633
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

653
0:44:37,0 --> 0:44:38,877
I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract,

654
0:44:39,0 --> 0:44:40,35
and when I wield it...

655
0:44:40,240 --> 0:44:41,912
Who showed you this power?

656
0:44:43,40 --> 0:44:44,314
Who controls the would-be king?

657
0:44:44,520 --> 0:44:46,238
- I am a king!
- Not here!

658
0:44:46,440 --> 0:44:47,668
You give up the Tesseract!

659
0:44:47,800 --> 0:44:50,234
You give up this poisonous dream!

660
0:44:52,840 --> 0:44:54,159
You come home.

661
0:44:58,920 --> 0:44:59,989
I don't have it.

662
0:45:2,0 --> 0:45:3,718
You need the Cube to bring me home.

663
0:45:3,840 --> 0:45:6,70
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

664
0:45:7,160 --> 0:45:8,912
You listen well, brother.

665
0:45:10,800 --> 0:45:11,949
I'm listening.

666
0:45:20,720 --> 0:45:22,312
Do not touch me again.

667
0:45:22,520 --> 0:45:24,33
Then don't take my stuff.

668
0:45:24,240 --> 0:45:26,390
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

669
0:45:28,200 --> 0:45:29,155
Shakespeare in the Park?

670
0:45:30,480 --> 0:45:33,472
Doth Mother know
you wear-eth her drapes?

671
0:45:33,720 --> 0:45:36,359
This is beyond you, metal man.

672
0:45:36,560 --> 0:45:38,596
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

673
0:45:38,800 --> 0:45:42,31
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours. Until then,

674
0:45:42,400 --> 0:45:43,594
stay out of the way.

675
0:45:45,80 --> 0:45:46,638
Tourist.

676
0:45:51,800 --> 0:45:52,789
Okay.

677
0:46:21,360 --> 0:46:24,158
Power at 400% capacity.

678
0:46:24,360 --> 0:46:25,839
How about that?

679
0:47:23,680 --> 0:47:24,829
Hey!

680
0:47:27,280 --> 0:47:28,429
That's enough.

681
0:47:32,160 --> 0:47:33,798
Now, I don't know
what you plan on doing here.

682
0:47:34,0 --> 0:47:36,195
I've come here to put an end
to Loki's schemes.

683
0:47:36,400 --> 0:47:38,834
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

684
0:47:38,960 --> 0:47:39,915
Yeah... No.

685
0:47:40,160 --> 0:47:41,559
Bad call. He loves his hammer.

686
0:47:43,80 --> 0:47:45,230
You want me to put the hammer down?

687
0:48:11,480 --> 0:48:13,72
Are we done, here?

688
0:48:59,0 --> 0:49:1,833
In case it's unclear,

689
0:49:2,520 --> 0:49:4,238
if you try to escape,

690
0:49:5,280 --> 0:49:7,475
if you so much as scratch that glass,

691
0:49:16,680 --> 0:49:20,468
it's 30,000 feet straight down
in a steel trap.

692
0:49:21,0 --> 0:49:23,36
You get how that works?

693
0:49:25,0 --> 0:49:27,514
Ant, boot.

694
0:49:30,720 --> 0:49:32,392
It's an impressive cage.

695
0:49:33,280 --> 0:49:35,794
Not built, I think, for me.

696
0:49:36,160 --> 0:49:38,469
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

697
0:49:38,680 --> 0:49:40,477
Oh, I've heard.

698
0:49:41,440 --> 0:49:42,555
A mindless beast.

699
0:49:43,520 --> 0:49:45,78
Makes play he's still a man.

700
0:49:46,120 --> 0:49:48,270
How desperate are you,

701
0:49:48,480 --> 0:49:51,438
that you call on such
lost creatures to defend you?

702
0:49:51,640 --> 0:49:53,870
How desperate am I?

703
0:49:54,80 --> 0:49:55,798
You threaten my world with war.

704
0:49:56,0 --> 0:49:58,36
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

705
0:49:58,240 --> 0:50:1,869
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

706
0:50:2,80 --> 0:50:4,958
You have made me very desperate.

707
0:50:5,160 --> 0:50:6,991
You might not be glad that you did.

708
0:50:10,120 --> 0:50:13,271
It burns you to have come so close.

709
0:50:14,680 --> 0:50:17,274
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

710
0:50:18,40 --> 0:50:20,156
unlimited power.

711
0:50:20,360 --> 0:50:22,237
And for what?

712
0:50:23,840 --> 0:50:24,520
A warm light for all mankind to share.

713
0:50:24,520 --> 0:50:27,478
A warm light for all mankind to share.

714
0:50:27,720 --> 0:50:30,837
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

715
0:50:34,760 --> 0:50:38,878
Well, let me know if "real power"
wants a magazine or something.

716
0:50:46,880 --> 0:50:48,279
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

717
0:50:48,480 --> 0:50:50,311
Loki's gonna drag this out.

718
0:50:50,520 --> 0:50:53,830
So, Thor, what's his play?

719
0:50:54,40 --> 0:50:56,474
He has an army called the Chitauri.

720
0:50:56,680 --> 0:50:59,478
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

721
0:50:59,880 --> 0:51:1,871
He means to lead them
against your people.

722
0:51:2,80 --> 0:51:3,593
They will win him the Earth,

723
0:51:3,720 --> 0:51:5,438
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

724
0:51:5,640 --> 0:51:7,312
An army

725
0:51:7,520 --> 0:51:9,112
from outer space.

726
0:51:9,320 --> 0:51:11,629
So, he's building another portal.

727
0:51:11,840 --> 0:51:13,114
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

728
0:51:13,240 --> 0:51:14,195
Selvig?

729
0:51:14,360 --> 0:51:16,590
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

730
0:51:16,800 --> 0:51:18,836
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

731
0:51:19,0 --> 0:51:20,433
along with one of ours.

732
0:51:20,640 --> 0:51:22,153
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

733
0:51:22,280 --> 0:51:23,508
He's not leading an army from here.

734
0:51:23,720 --> 0:51:25,358
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

735
0:51:25,560 --> 0:51:27,278
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

736
0:51:27,400 --> 0:51:28,628
You could smell crazy on him.

737
0:51:28,840 --> 0:51:30,512
Have care how you speak.

738
0:51:31,40 --> 0:51:33,156
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

739
0:51:33,560 --> 0:51:34,595
And he is my brother.

740
0:51:34,800 --> 0:51:36,597
He killed 80 people in two days.

741
0:51:37,440 --> 0:51:38,395
He's adopted.

742
0:51:38,560 --> 0:51:40,755
I think it's about the mechanics.

743
0:51:40,960 --> 0:51:42,837
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

744
0:51:43,40 --> 0:51:43,995
It's a stabilising agent.

745
0:51:44,160 --> 0:51:45,388
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

746
0:51:45,520 --> 0:51:46,999
I'll fly you to Portland.

747
0:51:47,200 --> 0:51:48,679
Keep love alive.

748
0:51:48,880 --> 0:51:50,677
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

749
0:51:50,840 --> 0:51:52,592
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

750
0:51:52,800 --> 0:51:55,951
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

751
0:51:56,160 --> 0:51:58,310
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

752
0:51:58,520 --> 0:52:0,829
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

753
0:52:1,520 --> 0:52:3,636
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

754
0:52:5,280 --> 0:52:6,429
That man is playing Galaga.

755
0:52:7,440 --> 0:52:10,671
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

756
0:52:12,560 --> 0:52:13,879
How does Fury even see these?

757
0:52:14,40 --> 0:52:14,995
He turns.

758
0:52:15,280 --> 0:52:16,838
Sounds exhausting.

759
0:52:17,880 --> 0:52:18,995
The rest of the raw materials,

760
0:52:19,200 --> 0:52:21,873
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

761
0:52:22,80 --> 0:52:23,399
The only major component
he still needs

762
0:52:23,600 --> 0:52:26,956
is a power source
of high-energy density.

763
0:52:27,160 --> 0:52:30,277
Something to kick-start the Cube.

764
0:52:30,480 --> 0:52:33,313
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

765
0:52:33,520 --> 0:52:34,475
Last night.

766
0:52:34,960 --> 0:52:38,32
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

767
0:52:38,240 --> 0:52:39,195
Am I the only one who did the reading?

768
0:52:39,360 --> 0:52:42,33
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

769
0:52:42,240 --> 0:52:44,834
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

770
0:52:45,40 --> 0:52:46,439
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

771
0:52:46,640 --> 0:52:48,756
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilise

772
0:52:48,960 --> 0:52:50,29
the quantum tunnelling effect.

773
0:52:50,240 --> 0:52:51,195
Well, if he could do that,

774
0:52:51,360 --> 0:52:53,715
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

775
0:52:53,920 --> 0:52:56,229
Finally, someone who speaks English.

776
0:52:56,440 --> 0:52:58,317
Is that what just happened?

777
0:52:58,520 --> 0:53:0,431
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

778
0:53:0,640 --> 0:53:3,552
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

779
0:53:3,760 --> 0:53:5,478
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

780
0:53:5,680 --> 0:53:7,636
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

781
0:53:9,120 --> 0:53:10,109
Thanks.

782
0:53:10,320 --> 0:53:12,709
Dr Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

783
0:53:12,920 --> 0:53:14,148
I was hoping you might join him.

784
0:53:14,360 --> 0:53:15,475
I would start with that stick of his.

785
0:53:15,600 --> 0:53:16,589
It may be magical,

786
0:53:16,720 --> 0:53:17,948
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

787
0:53:18,80 --> 0:53:20,992
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

788
0:53:21,280 --> 0:53:22,952
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

789
0:53:23,160 --> 0:53:24,673
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

790
0:53:24,800 --> 0:53:26,518
into his personal flying monkeys.

791
0:53:26,880 --> 0:53:28,359
Monkeys? I do not understand.

792
0:53:28,480 --> 0:53:29,435
I do.

793
0:53:32,320 --> 0:53:34,117
I understood that reference.

794
0:53:35,0 --> 0:53:36,274
Shall we play, Doctor?

795
0:53:36,480 --> 0:53:38,118
This way, sir.

796
0:53:51,520 --> 0:53:53,33
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

797
0:53:53,240 --> 0:53:55,151
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

798
0:53:55,520 --> 0:53:57,78
But it's going to take weeks to process.

799
0:53:57,280 --> 0:53:58,429
If we bypass their mainframe

800
0:53:58,560 --> 0:53:59,788
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

801
0:54:0,0 --> 0:54:2,958
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

802
0:54:4,80 --> 0:54:5,957
All I packed was a toothbrush.

803
0:54:7,0 --> 0:54:8,513
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

804
0:54:8,720 --> 0:54:10,676
Top ten floors, all R&D.

805
0:54:11,0 --> 0:54:12,399
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

806
0:54:12,600 --> 0:54:14,989
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

807
0:54:15,200 --> 0:54:17,634
I kind of broke Harlem.

808
0:54:17,840 --> 0:54:19,592
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

809
0:54:19,800 --> 0:54:21,518
No tension, no surprises.

810
0:54:22,960 --> 0:54:24,393
- Hey!
- Nothing?

811
0:54:24,600 --> 0:54:25,555
Are you nuts?

812
0:54:25,680 --> 0:54:26,635
Jury's out.

813
0:54:26,760 --> 0:54:27,829
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

814
0:54:27,960 --> 0:54:28,915
What's your secret?

815
0:54:29,40 --> 0:54:30,439
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

816
0:54:30,600 --> 0:54:31,669
Is everything a joke to you?

817
0:54:31,960 --> 0:54:32,915
Funny things are.

818
0:54:33,40 --> 0:54:34,712
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

819
0:54:34,840 --> 0:54:36,34
isn't funny.

820
0:54:36,160 --> 0:54:37,115
No offence, Doc.

821
0:54:37,240 --> 0:54:38,673
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

822
0:54:38,800 --> 0:54:41,519
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

823
0:54:41,640 --> 0:54:44,108
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

824
0:54:44,240 --> 0:54:45,832
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr Stark.

825
0:54:45,960 --> 0:54:47,393
Do you think I'm not?

826
0:54:47,520 --> 0:54:50,193
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

827
0:54:50,320 --> 0:54:51,992
What isn't he telling us?

828
0:54:52,120 --> 0:54:53,792
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

829
0:54:54,400 --> 0:54:55,594
You think Fury's hiding something?

830
0:54:55,720 --> 0:54:58,757
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

831
0:54:58,880 --> 0:55:0,552
His secrets have secrets.

832
0:55:0,680 --> 0:55:2,113
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

833
0:55:4,600 --> 0:55:6,318
I just want to finish my work here, and...

834
0:55:6,440 --> 0:55:7,395
Doctor?

835
0:55:12,600 --> 0:55:14,875
"A warm light for all mankind."

836
0:55:15,0 --> 0:55:16,991
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

837
0:55:17,120 --> 0:55:18,519
I heard it.

838
0:55:18,640 --> 0:55:20,835
I think that was meant for you.

839
0:55:21,520 --> 0:55:24,353
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

840
0:55:24,480 --> 0:55:25,515
it was still all over the news.

841
0:55:25,640 --> 0:55:27,631
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

842
0:55:28,920 --> 0:55:30,114
building in New York?

843
0:55:30,240 --> 0:55:33,789
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

844
0:55:33,920 --> 0:55:36,229
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

845
0:55:36,360 --> 0:55:38,112
It's just the prototype.

846
0:55:38,240 --> 0:55:40,117
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

847
0:55:40,520 --> 0:55:41,873
That's what he's getting at.

848
0:55:42,0 --> 0:55:44,468
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. Bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

849
0:55:44,600 --> 0:55:46,272
What are they doing
in the energy business

850
0:55:46,400 --> 0:55:47,674
in the first place?

851
0:55:47,800 --> 0:55:50,633
I should probably look into that
once my decryption programme

852
0:55:50,760 --> 0:55:52,830
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

853
0:55:52,960 --> 0:55:53,915
I'm sorry. Did you say...

854
0:55:54,40 --> 0:55:55,951
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

855
0:55:56,80 --> 0:55:57,593
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

856
0:55:57,720 --> 0:55:58,835
S.H.I.E.L.D. Has ever tried to hide.

857
0:55:58,960 --> 0:55:59,915
Blueberry?

858
0:56:0,40 --> 0:56:1,837
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

859
0:56:1,960 --> 0:56:4,679
An intelligence organisation
that fears intelligence?

860
0:56:4,800 --> 0:56:6,313
Historically, not awesome.

861
0:56:6,440 --> 0:56:8,635
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

862
0:56:8,760 --> 0:56:10,273
This is a man who means to start a war

863
0:56:10,400 --> 0:56:11,879
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

864
0:56:13,120 --> 0:56:15,475
We have orders.
We should follow them.

865
0:56:15,960 --> 0:56:17,871
Following's not really my style.

866
0:56:19,40 --> 0:56:21,315
And you're all about style, aren't you?

867
0:56:21,440 --> 0:56:22,429
Of the people in this room,

868
0:56:22,560 --> 0:56:24,73
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

869
0:56:24,200 --> 0:56:25,474
and, B, not of use?

870
0:56:25,600 --> 0:56:29,752
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

871
0:56:32,360 --> 0:56:33,349
Just find the Cube.

872
0:56:45,760 --> 0:56:47,591
That's the guy
my dad never shut up about?

873
0:56:48,40 --> 0:56:50,713
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

874
0:56:51,520 --> 0:56:53,158
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

875
0:56:53,280 --> 0:56:54,952
He does have the jump on us.

876
0:56:55,80 --> 0:56:57,674
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

877
0:56:57,800 --> 0:56:59,552
It's going to blow up in his face.

878
0:56:59,680 --> 0:57:1,875
And I'm going to be there when it does.

879
0:57:2,160 --> 0:57:4,230
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

880
0:57:6,280 --> 0:57:7,508
Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

881
0:57:9,40 --> 0:57:12,476
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

882
0:57:12,600 --> 0:57:15,797
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

883
0:57:15,920 --> 0:57:17,592
It's a nightmare.

884
0:57:17,720 --> 0:57:20,393
I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

885
0:57:20,520 --> 0:57:22,431
to crawl its way into my heart.

886
0:57:22,560 --> 0:57:24,516
This stops it.

887
0:57:24,640 --> 0:57:26,870
This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

888
0:57:28,40 --> 0:57:29,632
not just armour.

889
0:57:30,280 --> 0:57:32,635
It's a terrible privilege.

890
0:57:32,960 --> 0:57:35,235
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

891
0:57:35,360 --> 0:57:36,315
It's different.

892
0:57:36,640 --> 0:57:39,837
Hey, I read all about your accident.

893
0:57:39,960 --> 0:57:43,157
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

894
0:57:43,280 --> 0:57:45,635
So you're saying that the Hulk...

895
0:57:47,40 --> 0:57:49,315
The other guy saved my life?

896
0:57:49,800 --> 0:57:50,869
That's nice.

897
0:57:51,720 --> 0:57:55,349
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

898
0:57:56,600 --> 0:57:58,431
I guess we'll find out.

899
0:58:0,80 --> 0:58:1,672
You may not enjoy that.

900
0:58:1,800 --> 0:58:3,677
And you just might.

901
0:59:0,480 --> 0:59:1,799
As soon as Loki took the doctor,

902
0:59:1,920 --> 0:59:3,592
we moved Jane Foster.

903
0:59:3,720 --> 0:59:5,995
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromsø.

904
0:59:6,120 --> 0:59:9,510
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

905
0:59:9,640 --> 0:59:13,269
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

906
0:59:14,120 --> 0:59:15,109
She'll be safe.

907
0:59:15,240 --> 0:59:16,559
Thank you.

908
0:59:18,280 --> 0:59:20,236
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

909
0:59:21,200 --> 0:59:23,668
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

910
0:59:23,800 --> 0:59:24,869
Erik is a good man.

911
0:59:25,0 --> 0:59:25,955
He talks about you a lot.

912
0:59:27,760 --> 0:59:29,671
You changed his life.

913
0:59:31,320 --> 0:59:33,117
You changed everything around here.

914
0:59:33,240 --> 0:59:35,276
They were better as they were.

915
0:59:35,840 --> 0:59:37,831
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

916
0:59:37,960 --> 0:59:41,509
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

917
0:59:41,640 --> 0:59:43,392
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

918
0:59:43,520 --> 0:59:46,432
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

919
0:59:47,200 --> 0:59:48,918
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

920
0:59:49,40 --> 0:59:50,837
Well, they are repulsive.

921
0:59:52,120 --> 0:59:54,270
And they trample everything
in their path.

922
1:0:1,640 --> 1:0:4,837
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

923
1:0:4,960 --> 1:0:7,190
and your people paid the price.

924
1:0:7,320 --> 1:0:9,38
And now, again.

925
1:0:11,480 --> 1:0:13,835
In my youth, I courted war.

926
1:0:15,520 --> 1:0:17,431
War hasn't started yet.

927
1:0:18,520 --> 1:0:20,238
You think you could make Loki tell us

928
1:0:20,360 --> 1:0:21,588
where the Tesseract is?

929
1:0:21,720 --> 1:0:24,837
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

930
1:0:24,960 --> 1:0:29,476
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

931
1:0:29,600 --> 1:0:31,636
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

932
1:0:32,680 --> 1:0:34,796
A lot of guys think that

933
1:0:34,920 --> 1:0:36,353
until the pain starts.

934
1:0:38,560 --> 1:0:39,993
What are you asking me to do?

935
1:0:40,120 --> 1:0:43,556
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

936
1:0:43,680 --> 1:0:44,669
Loki is a prisoner.

937
1:0:44,800 --> 1:0:47,30
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

938
1:0:47,160 --> 1:0:48,673
that wants to be here?

939
1:1:0,760 --> 1:1:3,718
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

940
1:1:3,840 --> 1:1:5,432
But you figured I'd come.

941
1:1:6,80 --> 1:1:7,593
After.

942
1:1:8,440 --> 1:1:11,716
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

943
1:1:11,840 --> 1:1:15,355
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

944
1:1:16,280 --> 1:1:17,872
And I would cooperate.

945
1:1:18,0 --> 1:1:19,911
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

946
1:1:20,40 --> 1:1:21,951
I would say I've expanded his mind.

947
1:1:24,440 --> 1:1:26,271
And once you've won,

948
1:1:27,120 --> 1:1:28,348
once you're king of the mountain,

949
1:1:30,400 --> 1:1:32,789
what happens to his mind?

950
1:1:34,0 --> 1:1:35,718
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

951
1:1:35,840 --> 1:1:38,559
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

952
1:1:42,280 --> 1:1:44,77
Tell me.

953
1:1:48,240 --> 1:1:51,357
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L. D... I...

954
1:1:53,680 --> 1:1:57,434
Well, I made a name for myself.

955
1:1:57,560 --> 1:2:0,438
I have a very specific skill set.

956
1:2:0,560 --> 1:2:4,75
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

957
1:2:5,40 --> 1:2:8,396
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

958
1:2:9,520 --> 1:2:12,318
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

959
1:2:13,320 --> 1:2:14,799
He made a different call.

960
1:2:16,680 --> 1:2:19,592
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

961
1:2:19,960 --> 1:2:21,234
Not let you out.

962
1:2:21,360 --> 1:2:23,157
No, but I like this.

963
1:2:24,40 --> 1:2:27,316
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

964
1:2:27,440 --> 1:2:29,431
Regimes fall every day.

965
1:2:29,560 --> 1:2:31,994
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

966
1:2:32,120 --> 1:2:33,75
Or I was.

967
1:2:34,320 --> 1:2:35,912
And what are you now?

968
1:2:36,360 --> 1:2:39,193
It's really not that complicated.

969
1:2:39,320 --> 1:2:43,233
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

970
1:2:44,200 --> 1:2:45,679
Can you?

971
1:2:46,960 --> 1:2:50,589
Can you wipe out that much red?

972
1:2:51,720 --> 1:2:53,438
Dreykov's daughter,

973
1:2:54,800 --> 1:2:56,552
São Paulo,

974
1:2:57,560 --> 1:2:59,949
the hospital fire?

975
1:3:0,760 --> 1:3:3,35
Barton told me everything.

976
1:3:3,160 --> 1:3:6,118
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

977
1:3:6,240 --> 1:3:8,629
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

978
1:3:8,760 --> 1:3:10,79
will change anything?

979
1:3:10,200 --> 1:3:12,760
This is the basest sentimentality.

980
1:3:12,880 --> 1:3:15,30
This is a child at prayer.

981
1:3:15,160 --> 1:3:16,388
Pathetic!

982
1:3:17,160 --> 1:3:19,628
You lie and kill

983
1:3:19,760 --> 1:3:22,672
in the service of liars and killers.

984
1:3:25,640 --> 1:3:28,677
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,

985
1:3:28,800 --> 1:3:31,394
something that makes up
for the horrors.

986
1:3:32,520 --> 1:3:34,829
But they are part of you.

987
1:3:34,960 --> 1:3:38,589
And they will never go away.

988
1:3:39,160 --> 1:3:42,516
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

989
1:3:42,640 --> 1:3:44,790
Slowly, intimately,

990
1:3:44,920 --> 1:3:47,195
in every way he knows you fear.

991
1:3:47,320 --> 1:3:50,278
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

992
1:3:50,400 --> 1:3:53,710
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

993
1:3:53,840 --> 1:3:56,832
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

994
1:3:58,360 --> 1:3:59,873
You're a monster.

995
1:4:2,0 --> 1:4:3,433
Oh, no.

996
1:4:4,280 --> 1:4:5,793
You brought the monster.

997
1:4:8,680 --> 1:4:10,193
So, Banner.

998
1:4:11,200 --> 1:4:12,315
That's your play.

999
1:4:12,440 --> 1:4:13,429
What?

1000
1:4:14,360 --> 1:4:15,952
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

1001
1:4:16,80 --> 1:4:17,479
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

1002
1:4:17,600 --> 1:4:18,635
Send Thor as well.

1003
1:4:20,240 --> 1:4:21,514
Thank you

1004
1:4:21,640 --> 1:4:23,710
for your cooperation.

1005
1:4:30,920 --> 1:4:32,319
What are you doing, Mr Stark?

1006
1:4:32,440 --> 1:4:34,829
Kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1007
1:4:34,960 --> 1:4:36,757
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

1008
1:4:36,880 --> 1:4:38,393
We are. The model's locked

1009
1:4:38,520 --> 1:4:39,748
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

1010
1:4:39,880 --> 1:4:40,835
When we get a hit,

1011
1:4:40,960 --> 1:4:42,837
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1012
1:4:42,960 --> 1:4:45,360
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1013
1:4:45,360 --> 1:4:47,32
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1014
1:4:47,160 --> 1:4:48,229
What is "Phase 2"?

1015
1:4:50,360 --> 1:4:53,79
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. Uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1016
1:4:53,200 --> 1:4:54,872
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1017
1:4:55,0 --> 1:4:57,594
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

1018
1:4:57,720 --> 1:4:59,119
This does not mean that we're making...

1019
1:4:59,240 --> 1:5:0,195
I'm sorry, Nick.

1020
1:5:0,320 --> 1:5:2,515
What were you lying?

1021
1:5:2,640 --> 1:5:3,834
I was wrong, Director.

1022
1:5:3,960 --> 1:5:4,949
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1023
1:5:5,80 --> 1:5:6,69
Did you know about this?

1024
1:5:6,200 --> 1:5:7,474
You want to think about
removing yourself

1025
1:5:7,600 --> 1:5:8,874
from this environment, Doctor?

1026
1:5:9,0 --> 1:5:11,70
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1027
1:5:11,200 --> 1:5:12,315
Loki is manipulating you.

1028
1:5:12,440 --> 1:5:13,953
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1029
1:5:14,80 --> 1:5:15,672
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1030
1:5:15,800 --> 1:5:16,869
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1031
1:5:17,0 --> 1:5:18,228
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

1032
1:5:18,360 --> 1:5:19,918
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1033
1:5:20,40 --> 1:5:23,589
Is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

1034
1:5:24,200 --> 1:5:25,269
Because of him.

1035
1:5:26,520 --> 1:5:27,475
Me?

1036
1:5:28,400 --> 1:5:30,675
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

1037
1:5:30,800 --> 1:5:33,837
who had a grudge match
that levelled a small town.

1038
1:5:33,960 --> 1:5:36,76
We learned that
not only are we not alone

1039
1:5:36,200 --> 1:5:39,636
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1040
1:5:39,760 --> 1:5:41,910
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1041
1:5:42,40 --> 1:5:43,917
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

1042
1:5:44,40 --> 1:5:45,917
And you're not the only threat.

1043
1:5:46,40 --> 1:5:49,77
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

1044
1:5:49,720 --> 1:5:50,869
that can't be controlled.

1045
1:5:51,0 --> 1:5:52,69
Like you controlled the Cube?

1046
1:5:52,200 --> 1:5:53,394
Your work with the Tesseract

1047
1:5:53,520 --> 1:5:55,988
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1048
1:5:56,120 --> 1:5:57,439
It is a signal to all the realms

1049
1:5:57,560 --> 1:6:0,120
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1050
1:6:0,240 --> 1:6:1,275
A higher form?

1051
1:6:1,400 --> 1:6:2,355
You forced our hand.

1052
1:6:2,480 --> 1:6:3,435
We had to come up with something.

1053
1:6:3,560 --> 1:6:4,515
A nuclear deterrent.

1054
1:6:4,640 --> 1:6:6,551
Because that always
calms everything right down.

1055
1:6:6,680 --> 1:6:8,955
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

1056
1:6:9,80 --> 1:6:11,355
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

1057
1:6:11,480 --> 1:6:13,38
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1058
1:6:13,160 --> 1:6:14,229
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1059
1:6:14,360 --> 1:6:16,157
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

1060
1:6:16,280 --> 1:6:19,33
Excuse me, did we come to
your planet and blow stuff up?

1061
1:6:19,160 --> 1:6:20,957
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

1062
1:6:21,80 --> 1:6:22,479
Are you boys really that naïve?

1063
1:6:22,600 --> 1:6:24,397
S.H.I.E.L.D. Monitors potential threats.

1064
1:6:24,520 --> 1:6:25,748
Captain America's on threat watch?

1065
1:6:25,880 --> 1:6:26,835
We all are.

1066
1:6:26,960 --> 1:6:28,313
Wait, you're on that list?

1067
1:6:28,440 --> 1:6:29,919
Are you above or below angry bees?

1068
1:6:30,40 --> 1:6:32,76
Stark, so help me God,
if you make one more wisecrack...

1069
1:6:32,200 --> 1:6:33,394
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1070
1:6:33,520 --> 1:6:35,909
- Show some respect.
- Respect what?

1071
1:6:42,960 --> 1:6:45,758
Transport Six-Six-Bravo,
please relay confirm codes.

1072
1:6:45,880 --> 1:6:47,950
I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.

1073
1:6:48,80 --> 1:6:50,71
What is your haul? Over.

1074
1:6:50,200 --> 1:6:52,714
Arms and ammunition. Over.

1075
1:7:0,720 --> 1:7:2,836
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

1076
1:7:2,960 --> 1:7:4,598
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1077
1:7:4,720 --> 1:7:5,914
I mean, what are we, a team?

1078
1:7:6,40 --> 1:7:8,873
No, we're a chemical mixture
that makes chaos.

1079
1:7:9,0 --> 1:7:10,877
We're a time bomb.

1080
1:7:11,0 --> 1:7:12,752
You need to step away.

1081
1:7:12,880 --> 1:7:14,632
Why shouldn't the guy
let off a little steam?

1082
1:7:14,760 --> 1:7:16,796
You know damn well why. Back off!

1083
1:7:16,920 --> 1:7:19,36
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1084
1:7:19,160 --> 1:7:22,630
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

1085
1:7:22,760 --> 1:7:24,159
Take that off, what are you?

1086
1:7:24,280 --> 1:7:26,510
Genius, billionaire,
playboy, philanthropist.

1087
1:7:27,360 --> 1:7:30,397
I know guys with none of that
worth ten of you.

1088
1:7:30,520 --> 1:7:31,475
I've seen the footage.

1089
1:7:31,600 --> 1:7:33,750
The only thing you really
fight for is yourself.

1090
1:7:35,160 --> 1:7:36,991
You're not the guy
to make the sacrifice play,

1091
1:7:37,120 --> 1:7:39,509
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

1092
1:7:39,640 --> 1:7:41,676
I think I would just cut the wire.

1093
1:7:44,200 --> 1:7:46,316
Always a way out.

1094
1:7:46,440 --> 1:7:47,634
You may not be a threat

1095
1:7:47,760 --> 1:7:49,591
but you better stop pretending
to be a hero.

1096
1:7:49,720 --> 1:7:52,75
A hero? Like you?

1097
1:7:52,200 --> 1:7:54,156
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1098
1:7:54,280 --> 1:7:57,750
Everything special about you
came out of a bottle.

1099
1:8:22,0 --> 1:8:24,719
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1100
1:8:25,680 --> 1:8:28,990
You people are so petty and tiny.

1101
1:8:29,120 --> 1:8:30,75
Yeah, this is a team.

1102
1:8:30,200 --> 1:8:31,394
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1103
1:8:31,520 --> 1:8:32,589
Dr Banner back to his...

1104
1:8:32,720 --> 1:8:34,312
Where? You rented my room.

1105
1:8:34,440 --> 1:8:35,839
The cell was just in case...

1106
1:8:35,960 --> 1:8:37,439
In case you needed to kill me.

1107
1:8:37,560 --> 1:8:40,358
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1108
1:8:42,960 --> 1:8:45,758
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1109
1:8:45,880 --> 1:8:50,158
So, I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

1110
1:8:50,720 --> 1:8:51,869
So I moved on.

1111
1:8:52,0 --> 1:8:54,719
I focused on helping
other people. I was good.

1112
1:8:54,840 --> 1:8:56,956
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show

1113
1:8:57,80 --> 1:8:58,399
and put everyone here at risk.

1114
1:8:58,520 --> 1:9:0,511
You want to know my secret,
Agent Romanoff?

1115
1:9:0,640 --> 1:9:2,392
You want to know how I stay calm?

1116
1:9:5,80 --> 1:9:7,150
Dr Banner,

1117
1:9:7,920 --> 1:9:9,194
put down the sceptre.

1118
1:9:17,600 --> 1:9:18,715
Got it.

1119
1:9:19,520 --> 1:9:20,475
Sorry, kids,

1120
1:9:20,600 --> 1:9:22,272
you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

1121
1:9:22,400 --> 1:9:23,355
You located the Tesseract?

1122
1:9:23,480 --> 1:9:24,435
I could get there fastest.

1123
1:9:24,560 --> 1:9:26,596
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.

1124
1:9:26,720 --> 1:9:27,994
- You're not going alone.
- You're gonna stop me?

1125
1:9:28,120 --> 1:9:29,75
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1126
1:9:29,200 --> 1:9:30,428
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1127
1:9:30,560 --> 1:9:31,515
Put on the suit.

1128
1:9:34,280 --> 1:9:35,838
Oh, my God.

1129
1:9:50,720 --> 1:9:51,675
Put on the suit.

1130
1:9:51,800 --> 1:9:53,28
Yeah.

1131
1:9:55,680 --> 1:9:57,352
All hands to stations.

1132
1:10:1,320 --> 1:10:3,38
- Hill!
- External detonation.

1133
1:10:3,160 --> 1:10:4,354
Number three engine is down.

1134
1:10:4,480 --> 1:10:5,435
We've been hit.

1135
1:10:5,560 --> 1:10:6,675
- Can they get it running?
- Fire in engine three!

1136
1:10:6,800 --> 1:10:7,755
Talk to me.

1137
1:10:7,880 --> 1:10:9,438
Turbine looks mostly intact

1138
1:10:9,560 --> 1:10:11,357
but it's impossible to
get out there to make repairs

1139
1:10:11,480 --> 1:10:12,833
while we're in the air.

1140
1:10:12,960 --> 1:10:15,394
If we lose one more engine,
we won't be.

1141
1:10:15,520 --> 1:10:17,431
Somebody's got to get outside
and patch that engine.

1142
1:10:17,560 --> 1:10:19,198
- Stark, you copy that?
- I'm on it.

1143
1:10:19,320 --> 1:10:22,471
Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown
in the detention section

1144
1:10:22,600 --> 1:10:23,555
then get to the armoury.

1145
1:10:23,680 --> 1:10:24,749
Romanoff?

1146
1:10:28,240 --> 1:10:29,639
We're okay.

1147
1:10:32,120 --> 1:10:33,314
We're okay, right?

1148
1:10:45,400 --> 1:10:46,549
- Keep that engine down!
- Yes, sir.

1149
1:10:46,680 --> 1:10:48,318
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1150
1:10:48,440 --> 1:10:50,158
- Got it.
- Stay close.

1151
1:10:51,840 --> 1:10:53,273
Let's go, Level 4.

1152
1:10:54,200 --> 1:10:56,873
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1153
1:11:4,720 --> 1:11:5,835
Doctor?

1154
1:11:8,120 --> 1:11:9,75
Bruce?

1155
1:11:9,360 --> 1:11:12,875
You got to fight it.
This is just what Loki wants.

1156
1:11:14,200 --> 1:11:15,189
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1157
1:11:15,320 --> 1:11:16,275
Are you hurt?

1158
1:11:19,440 --> 1:11:21,556
We're going to be okay. All right?

1159
1:11:21,680 --> 1:11:24,319
I swear on my life,
I will get you out of this.

1160
1:11:24,440 --> 1:11:25,759
You will walk away and never ever...

1161
1:11:25,880 --> 1:11:27,871
Your life?

1162
1:11:43,720 --> 1:11:44,675
Bruce.

1163
1:12:20,40 --> 1:12:20,680
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1164
1:12:20,680 --> 1:12:23,69
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1165
1:12:23,200 --> 1:12:24,997
- Take us to the water!
- We're flying blind.

1166
1:12:25,120 --> 1:12:27,31
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

1167
1:12:27,160 --> 1:12:28,832
Is the sun coming up?

1168
1:12:29,560 --> 1:12:31,676
- Yes, sir.
- Then put it on the left.

1169
1:12:31,800 --> 1:12:33,392
Get us over water.

1170
1:12:33,520 --> 1:12:35,511
One more turbine goes down,
and we drop.

1171
1:12:37,680 --> 1:12:38,908
Thanks.

1172
1:12:42,120 --> 1:12:43,235
Stark!

1173
1:12:45,840 --> 1:12:47,432
Stark, I'm here!

1174
1:12:47,560 --> 1:12:48,993
Good.

1175
1:12:50,160 --> 1:12:52,71
Let's see what we've got.

1176
1:12:52,200 --> 1:12:53,792
I got to get this
superconducting coolant system

1177
1:12:53,920 --> 1:12:54,875
back online

1178
1:12:55,0 --> 1:12:56,399
before I can access the rotors,

1179
1:12:56,520 --> 1:12:58,272
work on dislodging the debris.

1180
1:13:0,720 --> 1:13:2,199
I need you to get to that
engine control panel

1181
1:13:2,320 --> 1:13:5,835
and tell me which relays
are in overload position.

1182
1:13:17,640 --> 1:13:19,119
What does it look like in there?

1183
1:13:19,800 --> 1:13:22,234
It seems to run
on some form of electricity.

1184
1:13:22,360 --> 1:13:24,32
Well, you're not wrong.

1185
1:14:25,240 --> 1:14:27,959
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1186
1:14:28,80 --> 1:14:29,35
Try to think!

1187
1:14:38,760 --> 1:14:40,557
Okay, the relays are intact.

1188
1:14:40,680 --> 1:14:42,79
What's our next move?

1189
1:14:42,200 --> 1:14:43,155
Even if I clear the rotors,

1190
1:14:43,280 --> 1:14:45,396
this thing won't
re-engage without a jump.

1191
1:14:45,520 --> 1:14:46,839
I'm going to have to
get in there and push.

1192
1:14:46,960 --> 1:14:48,632
If that thing gets up to
speed, you'll get shredded.

1193
1:14:48,760 --> 1:14:50,671
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

1194
1:14:50,800 --> 1:14:52,153
long enough to disengage
maglev and that could...

1195
1:14:52,280 --> 1:14:53,554
Speak English!

1196
1:14:54,840 --> 1:14:55,909
You see that red lever?

1197
1:14:57,160 --> 1:14:59,196
It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.

1198
1:14:59,320 --> 1:15:1,38
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1199
1:15:51,480 --> 1:15:53,198
We need full evac
on the lower hangar bay.

1200
1:15:56,280 --> 1:15:57,269
Grenade!

1201
1:16:11,800 --> 1:16:13,74
We've got a perimeter breach!

1202
1:16:13,200 --> 1:16:15,156
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. Gear.

1203
1:16:15,280 --> 1:16:17,271
Call-outs at every junction.

1204
1:16:24,280 --> 1:16:26,396
We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4.

1205
1:16:26,520 --> 1:16:27,999
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.

1206
1:16:28,120 --> 1:16:30,156
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1207
1:16:31,320 --> 1:16:32,275
Get his attention.

1208
1:16:32,400 --> 1:16:36,393
Escort 6-0, proceed to
Wishbone and engage hostile.

1209
1:16:36,520 --> 1:16:37,748
Don't get too close.

1210
1:16:37,880 --> 1:16:39,199
Copy.

1211
1:16:50,640 --> 1:16:51,959
Target acquired.

1212
1:16:56,80 --> 1:16:57,35
Target engaged.

1213
1:17:8,200 --> 1:17:9,679
Target angry, target angry!

1214
1:18:15,280 --> 1:18:17,396
They're not getting through
here, so what the hell...

1215
1:18:35,40 --> 1:18:37,190
Engine one is now in shut-down.

1216
1:18:45,280 --> 1:18:47,350
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1217
1:18:47,480 --> 1:18:49,277
Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.

1218
1:18:49,800 --> 1:18:51,552
It's Barton. He took out our systems.

1219
1:18:51,680 --> 1:18:54,69
He's headed for the detention level.

1220
1:18:54,200 --> 1:18:56,77
Does anybody copy?

1221
1:18:57,200 --> 1:18:59,236
This is Agent Romanoff.

1222
1:18:59,360 --> 1:19:0,759
I copy.

1223
1:19:5,200 --> 1:19:6,155
Stark, we're losing altitude.

1224
1:19:6,280 --> 1:19:7,679
Yeah, I noticed.

1225
1:19:35,520 --> 1:19:36,509
No!

1226
1:19:43,800 --> 1:19:46,394
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1227
1:20:27,640 --> 1:20:29,790
The humans think us immortal.

1228
1:20:30,840 --> 1:20:32,319
Should we test that?

1229
1:20:35,0 --> 1:20:36,149
Move away, please.

1230
1:20:40,440 --> 1:20:41,873
You like this?

1231
1:20:42,800 --> 1:20:45,917
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

1232
1:20:47,80 --> 1:20:49,230
Even I don't know what it does.

1233
1:20:50,0 --> 1:20:51,194
Do you want to find out?

1234
1:20:53,120 --> 1:20:54,519
No!

1235
1:22:1,200 --> 1:22:2,553
Natasha?

1236
1:22:32,840 --> 1:22:34,512
You're going to lose.

1237
1:22:36,480 --> 1:22:37,629
Am I?

1238
1:22:38,880 --> 1:22:41,269
It's in your nature.

1239
1:22:43,360 --> 1:22:45,590
Your heroes are scattered.

1240
1:22:45,720 --> 1:22:49,269
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1241
1:22:49,400 --> 1:22:50,958
Where is my disadvantage?

1242
1:22:51,600 --> 1:22:53,591
You lack conviction.

1243
1:22:54,400 --> 1:22:55,355
I don't think I'm...

1244
1:23:1,920 --> 1:23:3,560
So, that's what it does.

1245
1:23:5,560 --> 1:23:8,552
All hands
to crash stations immediately.

1246
1:23:35,40 --> 1:23:35,995
Cap, hit the lever.

1247
1:23:36,360 --> 1:23:38,828
I need a minute here!

1248
1:23:38,960 --> 1:23:39,995
Lever

1249
1:23:40,120 --> 1:23:41,189
now!

1250
1:23:52,680 --> 1:23:53,749
Help!

1251
1:24:27,920 --> 1:24:29,239
Sorry, boss.

1252
1:24:29,360 --> 1:24:30,998
The god rabbited.

1253
1:24:31,120 --> 1:24:32,519
Just stay awake.

1254
1:24:32,640 --> 1:24:34,198
Eyes on me.

1255
1:24:34,320 --> 1:24:35,799
No, I'm clocking out here.

1256
1:24:35,920 --> 1:24:37,353
Not an option.

1257
1:24:38,320 --> 1:24:40,197
It's okay, boss.

1258
1:24:42,40 --> 1:24:43,996
This was never gonna work

1259
1:24:44,120 --> 1:24:45,348
if they didn't have something

1260
1:24:46,640 --> 1:24:48,119
to...

1261
1:25:16,40 --> 1:25:17,792
Agent Coulson is down.

1262
1:25:19,120 --> 1:25:20,758
A medical team is on
its way to your location.

1263
1:25:20,880 --> 1:25:22,279
They're here.

1264
1:25:25,360 --> 1:25:26,918
They called it.

1265
1:25:42,720 --> 1:25:44,278
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1266
1:25:47,480 --> 1:25:49,516
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

1267
1:25:52,880 --> 1:25:54,472
We're dead in the air up here.

1268
1:25:54,600 --> 1:25:57,558
Our communications,
the location of the Cube,

1269
1:25:57,680 --> 1:25:59,989
Banner, Thor...

1270
1:26:1,240 --> 1:26:3,71
I got nothing for you.

1271
1:26:3,200 --> 1:26:5,998
I lost my one good eye.

1272
1:26:8,920 --> 1:26:11,798
Maybe I had that coming.

1273
1:26:15,840 --> 1:26:17,68
Yes,

1274
1:26:18,200 --> 1:26:21,397
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1275
1:26:22,800 --> 1:26:24,631
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1276
1:26:24,760 --> 1:26:27,672
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1277
1:26:31,480 --> 1:26:35,439
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1278
1:26:37,240 --> 1:26:40,437
called the Avengers Initiative.

1279
1:26:41,600 --> 1:26:43,636
The idea was to bring together a group

1280
1:26:43,760 --> 1:26:46,194
of remarkable people

1281
1:26:46,960 --> 1:26:49,679
to see if they could become
something more.

1282
1:26:51,0 --> 1:26:54,993
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1283
1:26:55,120 --> 1:26:58,317
to fight the battles that we never could.

1284
1:27:0,960 --> 1:27:5,590
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1285
1:27:7,840 --> 1:27:9,432
In heroes.

1286
1:27:17,200 --> 1:27:18,679
Well,

1287
1:27:19,520 --> 1:27:22,80
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1288
1:27:41,560 --> 1:27:43,949
You fell out of the sky.

1289
1:27:57,400 --> 1:27:58,833
Did I hurt anybody?

1290
1:27:58,960 --> 1:28:1,872
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1291
1:28:2,0 --> 1:28:5,151
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

1292
1:28:5,960 --> 1:28:6,949
Lucky.

1293
1:28:7,80 --> 1:28:8,638
Or just good aim.

1294
1:28:8,760 --> 1:28:10,273
You were awake when you fell.

1295
1:28:12,280 --> 1:28:14,236
- You saw?
- The whole thing.

1296
1:28:14,360 --> 1:28:15,918
Right through the ceiling.

1297
1:28:16,40 --> 1:28:19,828
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1298
1:28:19,960 --> 1:28:21,29
Here.

1299
1:28:22,360 --> 1:28:24,430
Didn't think those would
fit you until you shrunk down

1300
1:28:24,560 --> 1:28:26,869
to a regular-size feller.

1301
1:28:29,120 --> 1:28:30,348
Thank you.

1302
1:28:31,320 --> 1:28:32,514
Are you an alien?

1303
1:28:33,80 --> 1:28:34,229
What?

1304
1:28:34,520 --> 1:28:35,794
From outer space, an alien.

1305
1:28:36,400 --> 1:28:37,355
No.

1306
1:28:37,720 --> 1:28:40,712
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1307
1:28:51,120 --> 1:28:53,350
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1308
1:28:56,560 --> 1:28:58,551
You know that?

1309
1:28:59,360 --> 1:29:1,157
Is that what you know?

1310
1:29:3,520 --> 1:29:6,273
I've got no window.

1311
1:29:7,40 --> 1:29:8,360
I have to flush him out.

1312
1:29:9,240 --> 1:29:10,992
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

1313
1:29:11,120 --> 1:29:12,599
You don't understand.

1314
1:29:14,480 --> 1:29:17,597
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1315
1:29:18,360 --> 1:29:22,353
Pull you out
and stuff something else in?

1316
1:29:25,400 --> 1:29:27,675
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

1317
1:29:29,160 --> 1:29:31,435
You know that I do.

1318
1:29:38,720 --> 1:29:39,709
Why am I back?

1319
1:29:40,800 --> 1:29:42,119
How did you get him out?

1320
1:29:42,240 --> 1:29:44,959
Cognitive recalibration.

1321
1:29:45,80 --> 1:29:47,674
I hit you really hard on the head.

1322
1:29:47,800 --> 1:29:48,835
Thanks.

1323
1:29:52,960 --> 1:29:54,632
Natasha...

1324
1:29:55,280 --> 1:29:56,315
How many agents did I...

1325
1:29:56,440 --> 1:29:57,839
Don't.

1326
1:29:57,960 --> 1:30:0,76
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1327
1:30:0,640 --> 1:30:2,278
This is Loki.

1328
1:30:2,400 --> 1:30:4,914
This is monsters and magic,

1329
1:30:5,40 --> 1:30:6,598
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1330
1:30:6,720 --> 1:30:8,199
Loki, did he get away?

1331
1:30:8,320 --> 1:30:9,275
Yeah.

1332
1:30:9,600 --> 1:30:11,750
I don't suppose you know where.

1333
1:30:11,880 --> 1:30:13,598
I didn't need to know.

1334
1:30:13,720 --> 1:30:15,392
I didn't ask.

1335
1:30:18,520 --> 1:30:20,909
He's going to
make his play soon, though.

1336
1:30:21,240 --> 1:30:22,195
Today.

1337
1:30:22,320 --> 1:30:23,594
We got to stop him.

1338
1:30:24,240 --> 1:30:25,434
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1339
1:30:25,560 --> 1:30:27,437
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1340
1:30:28,600 --> 1:30:29,874
Well,

1341
1:30:31,520 --> 1:30:33,590
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

1342
1:30:33,720 --> 1:30:36,314
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1343
1:30:39,40 --> 1:30:40,553
Now you sound like you.

1344
1:30:41,240 --> 1:30:42,639
But you don't.

1345
1:30:44,480 --> 1:30:47,199
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1346
1:30:47,320 --> 1:30:51,871
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1347
1:30:53,560 --> 1:30:55,437
What did Loki do to you?

1348
1:30:56,160 --> 1:30:58,469
He didn't. I just...

1349
1:31:2,80 --> 1:31:3,559
Natasha.

1350
1:31:5,560 --> 1:31:7,471
I've been compromised.

1351
1:31:10,440 --> 1:31:12,476
I got red in my ledger.

1352
1:31:14,520 --> 1:31:16,511
I would like to wipe it out.

1353
1:31:31,880 --> 1:31:33,313
Was he married?

1354
1:31:33,440 --> 1:31:34,793
No.

1355
1:31:34,920 --> 1:31:38,959
There was a cellist, I think.

1356
1:31:40,480 --> 1:31:41,833
I'm sorry.

1357
1:31:42,520 --> 1:31:44,112
He seemed like a good man.

1358
1:31:45,360 --> 1:31:46,395
He was an idiot.

1359
1:31:46,520 --> 1:31:48,670
Why? For believing?

1360
1:31:48,800 --> 1:31:50,153
For taking on Loki alone.

1361
1:31:50,280 --> 1:31:51,918
He was doing his job.

1362
1:31:52,40 --> 1:31:54,474
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

1363
1:31:54,600 --> 1:31:55,589
He should have...

1364
1:31:55,720 --> 1:31:57,233
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1365
1:31:57,360 --> 1:31:59,396
Right, I've heard that before.

1366
1:31:59,520 --> 1:32:0,953
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1367
1:32:1,80 --> 1:32:2,798
We are not soldiers.

1368
1:32:7,80 --> 1:32:8,752
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1369
1:32:8,880 --> 1:32:9,995
Neither am I.

1370
1:32:10,120 --> 1:32:12,236
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

1371
1:32:12,360 --> 1:32:13,679
But right now,
we got to put that behind us

1372
1:32:13,800 --> 1:32:15,916
and get this done.

1373
1:32:16,40 --> 1:32:16,995
Loki needs a power source.

1374
1:32:17,120 --> 1:32:18,75
If we can put together a list...

1375
1:32:18,200 --> 1:32:19,155
He made it personal.

1376
1:32:19,320 --> 1:32:20,309
That's not the point.

1377
1:32:20,440 --> 1:32:22,715
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1378
1:32:22,840 --> 1:32:24,671
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1379
1:32:24,800 --> 1:32:25,755
To tear us apart.

1380
1:32:25,880 --> 1:32:27,677
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1381
1:32:27,800 --> 1:32:30,155
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

1382
1:32:30,280 --> 1:32:31,759
That's what he wants.

1383
1:32:31,880 --> 1:32:34,269
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1384
1:32:34,400 --> 1:32:35,469
He wants an audience.

1385
1:32:36,160 --> 1:32:37,752
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1386
1:32:37,880 --> 1:32:40,678
Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.

1387
1:32:40,800 --> 1:32:43,234
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1388
1:32:43,360 --> 1:32:44,873
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1389
1:32:45,0 --> 1:32:48,629
He wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered...

1390
1:32:50,320 --> 1:32:51,833
Son of a bitch.

1391
1:33:2,640 --> 1:33:3,629
Time to go.

1392
1:33:3,760 --> 1:33:5,239
- Go where?
- I'll tell you on the way.

1393
1:33:5,360 --> 1:33:6,315
Can you fly one of those jets?

1394
1:33:7,840 --> 1:33:9,34
I can.

1395
1:33:12,760 --> 1:33:13,749
You got a suit?

1396
1:33:13,880 --> 1:33:14,835
Yeah.

1397
1:33:14,960 --> 1:33:16,359
Then suit up.

1398
1:33:42,880 --> 1:33:44,108
Hey, you guys aren't
authorised to be in here.

1399
1:33:44,240 --> 1:33:46,470
Son, just don't.

1400
1:33:48,440 --> 1:33:49,395
Sir.

1401
1:33:49,520 --> 1:33:50,669
Agent Hill.

1402
1:33:51,200 --> 1:33:52,679
Those cards,

1403
1:33:54,720 --> 1:33:58,998
they were in Coulson's locker,
not in his jacket.

1404
1:34:3,240 --> 1:34:4,753
They needed the push.

1405
1:34:7,720 --> 1:34:9,915
We have an unauthorised departure
from Bay 6.

1406
1:34:10,760 --> 1:34:12,34
They found him.

1407
1:34:12,840 --> 1:34:16,389
Get our communications back up,
whatever you have to do.

1408
1:34:16,520 --> 1:34:18,670
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes, sir.

1409
1:34:31,680 --> 1:34:33,352
Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor

1410
1:34:33,480 --> 1:34:37,155
but the device
is already self-sustaining.

1411
1:34:37,280 --> 1:34:39,350
Shut it down, Dr Selvig.

1412
1:34:40,0 --> 1:34:41,228
It's too late!

1413
1:34:43,200 --> 1:34:44,599
She can't stop now.

1414
1:34:45,600 --> 1:34:47,955
She wants to show us something!

1415
1:34:48,80 --> 1:34:50,36
A new universe.

1416
1:34:50,160 --> 1:34:51,639
Okay.

1417
1:34:58,400 --> 1:35:0,197
The barrier is pure energy.

1418
1:35:0,320 --> 1:35:2,117
It's unbreachable.

1419
1:35:2,240 --> 1:35:3,958
Yeah, I got that.

1420
1:35:5,120 --> 1:35:6,75
Plan B.

1421
1:35:7,200 --> 1:35:9,191
Sir, the Mark 7
is not ready for deployment.

1422
1:35:9,320 --> 1:35:11,470
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

1423
1:35:30,400 --> 1:35:33,312
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

1424
1:35:34,400 --> 1:35:36,675
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1425
1:35:36,800 --> 1:35:38,199
You should have left
your armour on for that.

1426
1:35:38,320 --> 1:35:39,673
Yeah.

1427
1:35:39,800 --> 1:35:40,835
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1428
1:35:40,960 --> 1:35:43,474
and you've got
the glow stick of destiny.

1429
1:35:44,240 --> 1:35:46,435
Would you like a drink?

1430
1:35:46,560 --> 1:35:47,629
Stalling me won't change anything.

1431
1:35:47,760 --> 1:35:49,796
No, no. Threatening.

1432
1:35:49,920 --> 1:35:51,239
No drink? Are you sure?

1433
1:35:51,360 --> 1:35:52,839
I'm having one.

1434
1:35:53,840 --> 1:35:57,594
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

1435
1:35:58,440 --> 1:35:59,793
What have I to fear?

1436
1:35:59,920 --> 1:36:1,558
The Avengers.

1437
1:36:3,560 --> 1:36:5,790
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

1438
1:36:5,920 --> 1:36:7,478
"Earth's mightiest heroes"-type thing.

1439
1:36:7,600 --> 1:36:9,397
Yes, I've met them.

1440
1:36:9,520 --> 1:36:10,509
Yeah.

1441
1:36:10,640 --> 1:36:11,755
It takes us a while to get any traction,

1442
1:36:11,880 --> 1:36:12,835
I'll give you that one.

1443
1:36:12,960 --> 1:36:15,76
But let's do a head count, here.

1444
1:36:15,200 --> 1:36:17,589
Your brother, the demigod,

1445
1:36:19,240 --> 1:36:22,676
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend.

1446
1:36:22,800 --> 1:36:25,837
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

1447
1:36:25,960 --> 1:36:28,918
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella,

1448
1:36:29,520 --> 1:36:32,353
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

1449
1:36:32,480 --> 1:36:33,435
That was the plan.

1450
1:36:33,560 --> 1:36:35,471
Not a great plan.

1451
1:36:35,600 --> 1:36:37,556
When they come,

1452
1:36:37,680 --> 1:36:39,79
and they will,

1453
1:36:39,200 --> 1:36:40,394
they'll come for you.

1454
1:36:40,520 --> 1:36:41,475
I have an army.

1455
1:36:41,600 --> 1:36:42,715
We have a Hulk.

1456
1:36:43,200 --> 1:36:44,519
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1457
1:36:44,640 --> 1:36:46,471
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

1458
1:36:46,600 --> 1:36:50,434
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

1459
1:36:50,560 --> 1:36:52,790
Maybe your army comes
and maybe it's too much for us,

1460
1:36:52,920 --> 1:36:54,831
but it's all on you.

1461
1:36:55,600 --> 1:36:56,635
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1462
1:36:56,800 --> 1:36:59,792
you can be damn well sure
we'll avenge it.

1463
1:37:1,760 --> 1:37:4,672
How will your friends have time for me

1464
1:37:4,800 --> 1:37:6,518
when they are so busy fighting you?

1465
1:37:13,640 --> 1:37:14,629
This usually works.

1466
1:37:14,760 --> 1:37:17,479
Well, performance issues,
it's not uncommon.

1467
1:37:17,600 --> 1:37:19,431
One out of five...

1468
1:37:20,840 --> 1:37:21,360
Jarvis, anytime now.

1469
1:37:21,360 --> 1:37:23,635
Jarvis, anytime now.

1470
1:37:25,320 --> 1:37:27,959
You will all fall before me.

1471
1:37:28,80 --> 1:37:29,399
Deploy!

1472
1:37:29,520 --> 1:37:30,873
Deploy!

1473
1:37:56,960 --> 1:37:59,793
And there's one other
person you pissed off.

1474
1:38:0,880 --> 1:38:2,74
His name was Phil.

1475
1:38:24,880 --> 1:38:26,313
Right.

1476
1:38:26,440 --> 1:38:27,634
Army.

1477
1:39:37,40 --> 1:39:38,268
Loki!

1478
1:39:38,400 --> 1:39:40,356
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1479
1:39:40,480 --> 1:39:41,469
You can't.

1480
1:39:41,600 --> 1:39:43,397
There is no stopping it.

1481
1:39:43,520 --> 1:39:45,238
There is only

1482
1:39:45,360 --> 1:39:46,429
the war.

1483
1:39:46,560 --> 1:39:47,629
So be it.

1484
1:40:8,840 --> 1:40:10,512
Stark, we're on your three,
headed northeast.

1485
1:40:10,640 --> 1:40:12,676
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1486
1:40:12,800 --> 1:40:14,438
Swing up Park. I'm going
to lay them out for you.

1487
1:40:31,760 --> 1:40:33,34
Sir, we have more incoming.

1488
1:40:33,160 --> 1:40:34,832
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1489
1:40:41,440 --> 1:40:43,237
- Nat?
- I see him.

1490
1:41:25,760 --> 1:41:27,876
We got to get back up there.

1491
1:42:17,120 --> 1:42:18,712
Stark, are you seeing this?

1492
1:42:19,440 --> 1:42:21,795
Seeing. Still working on believing.

1493
1:42:21,920 --> 1:42:23,239
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?

1494
1:42:23,360 --> 1:42:24,349
Banner?

1495
1:42:24,480 --> 1:42:25,469
Just keep me posted.

1496
1:42:26,160 --> 1:42:28,230
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1497
1:42:30,400 --> 1:42:32,197
Look at this!

1498
1:42:32,320 --> 1:42:33,275
Look around you!

1499
1:42:34,240 --> 1:42:37,949
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

1500
1:42:38,80 --> 1:42:39,513
It's too late.

1501
1:42:40,960 --> 1:42:42,154
It's too late to stop it.

1502
1:42:42,280 --> 1:42:45,989
No. We can, together.

1503
1:42:52,320 --> 1:42:54,356
Sentiment.

1504
1:43:20,800 --> 1:43:23,234
We've got civilians
still trapped up here.

1505
1:43:24,360 --> 1:43:25,315
Loki.

1506
1:43:36,480 --> 1:43:38,198
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1507
1:43:43,440 --> 1:43:45,317
We got this. It's good. Go.

1508
1:43:45,440 --> 1:43:46,759
Do you think you can hold them off?

1509
1:43:46,880 --> 1:43:47,835
Captain,

1510
1:43:49,760 --> 1:43:52,479
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1511
1:44:18,240 --> 1:44:19,878
Just like Budapest all over again.

1512
1:44:20,480 --> 1:44:22,869
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

1513
1:44:38,360 --> 1:44:39,315
It's going to be an hour

1514
1:44:39,440 --> 1:44:40,668
before they can
scramble the National Guard.

1515
1:44:40,800 --> 1:44:42,518
National Guard?

1516
1:44:43,440 --> 1:44:44,873
Does the army know
what's happening here?

1517
1:44:45,120 --> 1:44:46,75
Do we?

1518
1:44:47,240 --> 1:44:48,389
You need men in these buildings.

1519
1:44:48,520 --> 1:44:49,953
There are people inside and
they're going to be running

1520
1:44:50,80 --> 1:44:51,229
right into the line of fire.

1521
1:44:51,360 --> 1:44:53,191
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

1522
1:44:53,320 --> 1:44:54,833
You keep them off the streets.

1523
1:44:54,960 --> 1:44:57,474
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1524
1:44:57,600 --> 1:44:59,158
Why the hell
should I take orders from you?

1525
1:45:12,640 --> 1:45:13,789
I need men in those buildings.

1526
1:45:13,920 --> 1:45:15,911
Lead the people down
and away from the streets.

1527
1:45:16,40 --> 1:45:18,508
We're going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

1528
1:45:28,480 --> 1:45:29,993
Well, we got its attention.

1529
1:45:30,120 --> 1:45:31,917
What the hell was step two?

1530
1:46:0,240 --> 1:46:1,195
What's the story upstairs?

1531
1:46:1,320 --> 1:46:3,151
The power surrounding the Cube
is impenetrable.

1532
1:46:3,280 --> 1:46:5,794
Thor's right. We got
to deal with these guys.

1533
1:46:5,920 --> 1:46:7,478
- How do we do this?
- As a team.

1534
1:46:7,600 --> 1:46:8,828
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1535
1:46:9,360 --> 1:46:10,349
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1536
1:46:10,480 --> 1:46:11,435
Save it.

1537
1:46:11,560 --> 1:46:12,834
Loki's going to keep
this fight focused on us,

1538
1:46:12,960 --> 1:46:13,949
and that's what we need.

1539
1:46:14,80 --> 1:46:15,672
Without him,
these things could run wild.

1540
1:46:15,800 --> 1:46:18,633
We got Stark up top.
He's going to need us to...

1541
1:46:25,680 --> 1:46:29,309
So, this all seems horrible.

1542
1:46:29,760 --> 1:46:30,829
I've seen worse.

1543
1:46:31,360 --> 1:46:32,315
Sorry.

1544
1:46:32,440 --> 1:46:35,0
No, we could use a little worse.

1545
1:46:35,120 --> 1:46:37,429
- Stark, we got him.
- Banner?

1546
1:46:37,560 --> 1:46:38,754
Just like you said.

1547
1:46:38,880 --> 1:46:41,474
Then tell him to suit up.
I'm bringing the party to you.

1548
1:46:47,680 --> 1:46:49,671
I don't see how that's a party.

1549
1:46:57,200 --> 1:46:58,155
Dr Banner.

1550
1:46:59,840 --> 1:47:1,558
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

1551
1:47:2,560 --> 1:47:4,915
That's my secret, Captain.

1552
1:47:6,560 --> 1:47:7,754
I'm always angry.

1553
1:47:18,760 --> 1:47:20,318
Hold on!

1554
1:47:49,0 --> 1:47:50,479
Send the rest.

1555
1:47:56,960 --> 1:47:58,154
Guys.

1556
1:47:58,280 --> 1:47:59,429
Call it, Captain.

1557
1:47:59,560 --> 1:48:0,675
All right, listen up.

1558
1:48:0,800 --> 1:48:3,473
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

1559
1:48:3,600 --> 1:48:4,874
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1560
1:48:5,0 --> 1:48:6,797
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

1561
1:48:6,920 --> 1:48:8,239
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1562
1:48:8,360 --> 1:48:9,475
Anything gets
more than three blocks out,

1563
1:48:9,600 --> 1:48:11,79
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1564
1:48:11,200 --> 1:48:12,349
- Can you give me a lift?
- Right.

1565
1:48:12,480 --> 1:48:13,515
Better clench up, Legolas.

1566
1:48:16,960 --> 1:48:19,235
Thor, you got to try
and bottleneck that portal.

1567
1:48:19,360 --> 1:48:20,475
Slow them down.

1568
1:48:20,600 --> 1:48:22,670
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

1569
1:48:24,880 --> 1:48:26,438
You and me,
we stay here on the ground.

1570
1:48:26,560 --> 1:48:27,549
We keep the fighting here.

1571
1:48:27,680 --> 1:48:28,635
And Hulk...

1572
1:48:31,240 --> 1:48:32,275
Smash.

1573
1:49:23,680 --> 1:49:24,749
Sir.

1574
1:49:25,760 --> 1:49:26,715
The Council is on.

1575
1:49:31,400 --> 1:49:34,517
Stark, you got a lot of strays
sniffing your tail.

1576
1:49:36,280 --> 1:49:38,236
I'm just trying to keep them
off the streets.

1577
1:49:38,360 --> 1:49:40,510
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1578
1:49:40,640 --> 1:49:41,755
So find a tight corner.

1579
1:49:41,880 --> 1:49:43,154
I will roger that.

1580
1:50:5,200 --> 1:50:6,315
Oh, boy.

1581
1:50:13,40 --> 1:50:14,598
Nice call.

1582
1:50:14,720 --> 1:50:15,869
What else you got?

1583
1:50:16,0 --> 1:50:18,673
Thor is taking on
a squadron down on Sixth.

1584
1:50:18,800 --> 1:50:20,916
And he didn't invite me.

1585
1:50:58,800 --> 1:51:0,358
Captain, none of this
is going to mean a damn thing

1586
1:51:0,480 --> 1:51:1,674
if we don't close that portal.

1587
1:51:1,800 --> 1:51:3,392
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1588
1:51:3,520 --> 1:51:5,670
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1589
1:51:7,520 --> 1:51:9,397
If you want to get up there,
you're going to need a ride.

1590
1:51:10,440 --> 1:51:11,475
I got a ride.

1591
1:51:12,560 --> 1:51:13,549
I could use a boost, though.

1592
1:51:16,40 --> 1:51:16,995
Are you sure about this?

1593
1:51:17,440 --> 1:51:19,874
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1594
1:51:45,800 --> 1:51:47,597
Okay, turn, turn.

1595
1:51:47,720 --> 1:51:49,392
Less! Less!

1596
1:53:8,720 --> 1:53:11,553
Captain, the bank
on 42nd past Madison.

1597
1:53:11,680 --> 1:53:13,352
They've cornered
a lot of civilians in there.

1598
1:53:13,480 --> 1:53:15,311
I'm on it.

1599
1:53:34,600 --> 1:53:36,318
Everyone! Clear out!

1600
1:54:5,0 --> 1:54:6,592
Director Fury,

1601
1:54:6,720 --> 1:54:8,438
the Council has made a decision.

1602
1:54:8,560 --> 1:54:11,199
I recognise the Council
has made a decision.

1603
1:54:11,320 --> 1:54:12,833
But given that
it's a stupid-ass decision,

1604
1:54:12,960 --> 1:54:14,313
I have elected to ignore it.

1605
1:54:14,440 --> 1:54:17,637
Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.

1606
1:54:17,760 --> 1:54:18,715
You scramble that jet...

1607
1:54:18,840 --> 1:54:21,434
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

1608
1:54:21,560 --> 1:54:23,551
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1609
1:54:23,680 --> 1:54:25,557
I will not order a nuclear strike

1610
1:54:25,720 --> 1:54:27,73
against a civilian population.

1611
1:54:27,200 --> 1:54:29,509
If we don't hold them here,
we lose everything.

1612
1:54:29,640 --> 1:54:32,279
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1613
1:54:35,880 --> 1:54:37,518
You.

1614
1:54:39,680 --> 1:54:40,795
Hawkeye!

1615
1:54:42,200 --> 1:54:43,155
Nat, what are you doing?

1616
1:54:44,40 --> 1:54:44,995
A little help?

1617
1:54:50,80 --> 1:54:51,35
I got him.

1618
1:55:16,520 --> 1:55:17,475
Enough!

1619
1:55:17,800 --> 1:55:20,155
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1620
1:55:20,280 --> 1:55:22,919
I am a god, you dull creature.

1621
1:55:23,40 --> 1:55:24,473
And I will not be bullied by...

1622
1:55:33,920 --> 1:55:35,717
Puny god.

1623
1:55:43,520 --> 1:55:44,919
The sceptre...

1624
1:55:46,40 --> 1:55:47,189
Doctor.

1625
1:55:49,0 --> 1:55:51,719
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1626
1:55:51,840 --> 1:55:53,432
The Tesseract can't fight,

1627
1:55:53,560 --> 1:55:55,516
but you can't protect against yourself.

1628
1:55:55,640 --> 1:55:56,595
It's not your fault.

1629
1:55:56,720 --> 1:55:57,914
You didn't know what you were doing.

1630
1:56:0,840 --> 1:56:2,910
Actually, I think I did.

1631
1:56:3,40 --> 1:56:5,873
I built in a safety
to cut their power source.

1632
1:56:7,40 --> 1:56:8,393
Loki's sceptre.

1633
1:56:8,520 --> 1:56:10,988
It may be able to close the portal.

1634
1:56:13,0 --> 1:56:15,70
And I'm looking right at it.

1635
1:56:26,560 --> 1:56:30,269
Sir, we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell.

1636
1:56:36,640 --> 1:56:39,791
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1637
1:56:39,920 --> 1:56:42,195
I wouldn't consider him a role model.

1638
1:57:48,960 --> 1:57:50,678
Director Fury is no longer in command.

1639
1:57:50,800 --> 1:57:52,756
Override order 7-Alpha- 1- 1.

1640
1:57:52,880 --> 1:57:55,348
7- Alpha- 1- 1, confirmed.
We're go for takeoff.

1641
1:57:56,200 --> 1:57:58,191
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1642
1:57:58,680 --> 1:58:0,591
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

1643
1:58:0,720 --> 1:58:1,948
We need to shut it down!

1644
1:58:2,80 --> 1:58:4,196
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

1645
1:58:33,480 --> 1:58:35,550
Stark, do you hear me?

1646
1:58:35,680 --> 1:58:37,716
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

1647
1:58:38,240 --> 1:58:39,559
How long?

1648
1:58:39,680 --> 1:58:41,671
Three minutes, max.

1649
1:58:41,800 --> 1:58:43,358
The payload will wipe out Midtown.

1650
1:58:43,480 --> 1:58:45,436
Jarvis, put everything we got
into the thrusters.

1651
1:58:45,560 --> 1:58:47,152
I just did.

1652
1:58:59,520 --> 1:59:0,794
Package is sent.

1653
1:59:0,920 --> 1:59:3,912
Detonation in
2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.

1654
1:59:25,760 --> 1:59:28,35
Are you ready for another bout?

1655
1:59:28,680 --> 1:59:29,669
What, are you getting sleepy?

1656
1:59:35,40 --> 1:59:36,712
Right at the crown!

1657
1:59:42,480 --> 1:59:44,198
I can close it.

1658
1:59:44,320 --> 1:59:46,276
Can anybody copy?

1659
1:59:46,400 --> 1:59:47,469
I can shut the portal down.

1660
1:59:47,600 --> 1:59:49,556
- Do it!
- No, wait.

1661
1:59:49,680 --> 1:59:50,874
Stark, these things are still coming.

1662
1:59:51,0 --> 1:59:51,955
I got a nuke coming in.

1663
1:59:52,80 --> 1:59:53,911
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1664
2:0:3,200 --> 2:0:4,952
And I know just where to put it.

1665
2:0:11,840 --> 2:0:14,115
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.

1666
2:0:14,240 --> 2:0:15,559
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1667
2:0:15,680 --> 2:0:19,593
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

1668
2:0:19,720 --> 2:0:21,676
Might as well.

1669
2:0:23,520 --> 2:0:25,795
The streets of New York City
have become a battleground.

1670
2:0:25,920 --> 2:0:28,514
The Army is here trying
to contain the violence

1671
2:0:28,640 --> 2:0:30,39
but clearly, it is outmatched.

1672
2:0:30,160 --> 2:0:32,355
And I have to say,
in all my years of reporting,

1673
2:0:32,480 --> 2:0:35,278
I have never seen anything like this.

1674
2:0:35,400 --> 2:0:36,833
We have limited information
on the team

1675
2:0:36,960 --> 2:0:40,555
but we do know that
billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...

1676
2:1:50,880 --> 2:1:52,632
Come on, Stark.

1677
2:1:59,0 --> 2:2:0,69
Close it.

1678
2:2:19,320 --> 2:2:20,275
Son of a gun.

1679
2:2:24,840 --> 2:2:26,398
He's not slowing down.

1680
2:2:43,720 --> 2:2:45,119
Is he breathing?

1681
2:3:11,840 --> 2:3:13,193
What the hell?

1682
2:3:15,800 --> 2:3:17,836
What just happened?

1683
2:3:17,960 --> 2:3:20,155
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1684
2:3:24,280 --> 2:3:25,872
We won.

1685
2:3:28,120 --> 2:3:29,348
All right, yay!

1686
2:3:29,480 --> 2:3:31,357
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1687
2:3:31,480 --> 2:3:34,552
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.

1688
2:3:35,400 --> 2:3:36,913
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1689
2:3:37,320 --> 2:3:39,515
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1690
2:3:39,640 --> 2:3:41,232
I don't know what it is,
but I want to try it.

1691
2:3:41,640 --> 2:3:43,39
We're not finished yet.

1692
2:3:47,800 --> 2:3:49,836
And then shawarma after.

1693
2:4:10,600 --> 2:4:12,750
If it's all the same to you,

1694
2:4:15,920 --> 2:4:17,512
I'll have that drink now.

1695
2:4:25,80 --> 2:4:27,36
Despite the devastation
of what has been confirmed

1696
2:4:27,160 --> 2:4:28,798
as an extraterrestrial attack,

1697
2:4:28,920 --> 2:4:30,399
the extraordinary heroics

1698
2:4:30,520 --> 2:4:32,397
of the group known as the Avengers

1699
2:4:32,520 --> 2:4:33,999
has been to many a cause
not only for comfort,

1700
2:4:34,120 --> 2:4:35,75
but for celebration.

1701
2:4:35,200 --> 2:4:37,509
It's just really great knowing
they're out there.

1702
2:4:37,640 --> 2:4:39,358
That someone is watching over us.

1703
2:4:39,480 --> 2:4:40,629
I love you, Thor!

1704
2:4:40,760 --> 2:4:42,398
And then these guys were like...

1705
2:4:42,520 --> 2:4:43,794
And then the air goes...

1706
2:4:43,920 --> 2:4:45,239
And this green guy walks up
and he goes...

1707
2:4:45,360 --> 2:4:46,349
I don't know.

1708
2:4:46,480 --> 2:4:48,835
I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.

1709
2:4:48,960 --> 2:4:51,918
It just seems that there's
a lot they're not telling us.

1710
2:4:52,40 --> 2:4:55,316
Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.

1711
2:4:55,440 --> 2:4:57,271
These so-called "heroes"

1712
2:4:57,400 --> 2:4:58,628
have to be held responsible

1713
2:4:58,760 --> 2:5:0,830
for the destruction done to this city.

1714
2:5:0,960 --> 2:5:2,996
This was their fight.
Where are they now?

1715
2:5:3,120 --> 2:5:3,600
Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.

1716
2:5:3,600 --> 2:5:5,830
Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.

1717
2:5:5,960 --> 2:5:6,915
Their sudden appearance

1718
2:5:7,40 --> 2:5:8,359
and equally sudden disappearance...

1719
2:5:8,480 --> 2:5:11,153
What, this is all somehow their fault?

1720
2:5:13,120 --> 2:5:16,157
Captain America saved my life.

1721
2:5:18,200 --> 2:5:21,556
Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,

1722
2:5:21,680 --> 2:5:23,113
I would just...

1723
2:5:23,880 --> 2:5:26,75
I would want to say thank you.

1724
2:5:28,440 --> 2:5:29,873
Where are the Avengers?

1725
2:5:30,0 --> 2:5:32,309
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

1726
2:5:32,440 --> 2:5:34,510
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

1727
2:5:34,640 --> 2:5:36,153
And the Tesseract?

1728
2:5:36,280 --> 2:5:38,430
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

1729
2:5:38,840 --> 2:5:41,70
Out of our reach.

1730
2:5:41,200 --> 2:5:42,679
That's not your call.

1731
2:5:42,800 --> 2:5:43,789
I didn't make it.

1732
2:5:43,920 --> 2:5:46,70
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1733
2:5:46,200 --> 2:5:47,918
So, you let him take it

1734
2:5:48,40 --> 2:5:49,598
and the war criminal, Loki,

1735
2:5:49,720 --> 2:5:51,358
who should be
answering for his crime.

1736
2:5:51,480 --> 2:5:53,948
I think he will be.

1737
2:6:6,880 --> 2:6:9,440
I don't think you understand
what you've started,

1738
2:6:9,560 --> 2:6:11,915
letting the Avengers
loose on this world.

1739
2:6:12,440 --> 2:6:13,395
They're dangerous.

1740
2:6:13,520 --> 2:6:17,35
They surely are,
and the whole world knows it.

1741
2:6:17,560 --> 2:6:20,28
Every world knows it.

1742
2:6:20,440 --> 2:6:22,431
Was that the point of all this?

1743
2:6:22,560 --> 2:6:24,232
A statement?

1744
2:6:26,840 --> 2:6:28,239
A promise.

1745
2:6:36,600 --> 2:6:38,79
Sir, how does it work now?

1746
2:6:39,160 --> 2:6:41,71
They've gone their separate ways.

1747
2:6:41,200 --> 2:6:43,998
Some, pretty extremely far.

1748
2:6:44,720 --> 2:6:46,551
If we get into a situation like this again,

1749
2:6:46,680 --> 2:6:48,159
what happens then?

1750
2:6:48,280 --> 2:6:49,235
They'll come back.

1751
2:6:50,680 --> 2:6:52,318
Are you really sure about that?

1752
2:6:52,440 --> 2:6:53,395
I am.

1753
2:6:54,960 --> 2:6:56,109
Why?

1754
2:6:57,120 --> 2:6:59,236
Because we'll need them to.

1755
2:9:43,800 --> 2:9:46,189
Humans.

1756
2:9:47,440 --> 2:9:51,592
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

1757
2:9:52,520 --> 2:9:54,590
They stand.

1758
2:9:55,400 --> 2:10:1,589
They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.

1759
2:10:8,280 --> 2:10:11,33
To challenge them

1760
2:10:11,160 --> 2:10:14,709
is to court death.
