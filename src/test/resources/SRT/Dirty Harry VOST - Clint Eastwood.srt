
1 
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:30,974 
Jesus! 

2 
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:33,376 
"To the city of San Francisco. 

3 
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:36,851 
I will enjoy killing 
one person every day... 

4 
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:40,012 
...until you pay me 
one hundred thousand dollars. 

5 
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:43,252 
If you agree, 
say so tomorrow morning... 

6 
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:46,378 
...at personal column, 
San Francisco Chronicle... 

7 
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:48,372 
...and I will set up meeting. 

8 
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:50,178 
If I do not hear from you... 

9 
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:53,891 
...it'll be my next pleasure 
to kill a Catholic priest or a..." 

10 
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:57,690 
"Scorpio." 

11 
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,413 
What goes on in their minds? 

12 
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,854 
Kooks. 

13 
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:07,854 
Where the hell does he expect me to 
find a hundred thousand dollars? 

14 
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:11,410 
You're not thinking of paying him, 
are you, Mr. Mayor? 

15 
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:16,333 
The City of San Francisco does not 
pay criminals not to commit crimes. 

16 
00:06:17,382 --> 00:06:19,336 
Instead, we pay a police department. 

17 
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:22,611 
Chief, who's in charge of this case? 

18 
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:25,537 
Inspector Callahan. 
He's outside. 

19 
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,814 
Send Inspector Callahan in. 

20 
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:36,208 
Callahan? 

21 
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:39,650 
Mr. Mayor, Inspector Callahan. 

22 
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:40,968 
All right. 

23 
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,334 
Let's have it. 

24 
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:46,696 
- Have what? 
- Your report. What have you been doing? 

25 
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,491 
For the past 3/4 hour... 

26 
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,537 
...I've been sitting on my ass 
waiting on you. 

27 
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:55,492 
Damn it, Harry. 
It's the mayor you're talking to. 

28 
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:01,056 
Won't you sit down, Inspector Callahan? 

29 
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:12,810 
There's a madman loose. 

30 
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:16,176 
I've asked you what's being done. 
Fair enough? 

31 
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,211 
We've got a dozen men 
checking identification files. 

32 
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,894 
Checking on all known extortionists, 
rooftop prowlers... 

33 
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,287 
...rifle nuts, peepers... 

34 
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,051 
Mr. Mayor? 

35 
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,211 
We've arranged for rooftop 
surveillance and helicopters... 

36 
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,888 
...especially around 
the Catholic churches and schools... 

37 
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:37,610 
...and in the black area. 

38 
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:40,052 
Ballistics is checking on the slug. 

39 
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:41,616 
We're sure it's a 30-06. 

40 
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:44,610 
Seven lands and grooves, 
right-hand twist... 

41 
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,410 
We're running a computer check... 

42 
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:50,332 
...on everybody in the files 
whose birthday falls between... 

43 
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:52,056 
...October 23 and November 21. 

44 
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:53,252 
Why? 

45 
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:55,206 
Natives of Scorpio. 

46 
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:58,291 
Thank you, inspector. 

47 
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,727 
Have you mentioned this note to anyone? 

48 
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:05,616 
How about you? 

49 
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,006 
Nobody. 

50 
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,014 
Your wife, sweetheart? 
Press? 

51 
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:10,445 
Nobody. 

52 
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:16,487 
All right. Give the message 
to the Chronicle. 

53 
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:19,888 
We'll pay. But we need time 
to get the money together. 

54 
00:08:20,138 --> 00:08:22,013 
Wait a minute. Do I get this right? 

55 
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:23,934 
You'll play this creep's game? 

56 
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:25,894 
It'll give us breathing space. 

57 
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:28,093 
It might get somebody killed. 

58 
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,774 
Let me meet with the son of a bitch! 

59 
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:34,531 
Nope, none of that. 
We would end up with a real bloodbath. 

60 
00:08:34,738 --> 00:08:37,455 
I agree with the chief. 
We'll do it this way. 

61 
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:40,449 
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. 
Come on, Callahan, let's go. 

62 
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,411 
I don't want trouble, like you had 
last year in the Fillmore district. 

63 
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:52,569 
That's my policy. 

64 
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:55,967 
When an adult male 
is chasing a female... 

65 
00:08:56,218 --> 00:09:00,334 
...with intent to commit rape, 
I shoot the bastard. That's my policy. 

66 
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:02,129 
Intent? 

67 
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:03,968 
How did you establish that? 

68 
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:10,371 
When a naked man chases a woman in 
an alley with a knife and a hard-on... 

69 
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,925 
...I figure he isn't out 
collecting for the Red Cross. 

70 
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:19,411 
I think he's got a point. 

71 
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:14,925 
- Inspector Callahan. 
- Jaffe. 

72 
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,609 
Usual. 

73 
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:19,729 
Usual lunch, or usual dinner? 

74 
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:21,412 
What difference does it make? 

75 
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:23,567 
Not much. 

76 
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:27,366 
Hey, Jaffe... 

77 
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,201 
...is that tan Ford still 
in front of the bank? 

78 
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:34,401 
Tan Ford? 

79 
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:39,322 
Yeah, tan Ford. 

80 
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:41,285 
Engine running? 

81 
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:44,212 
I don't know. 
How can I tell? 

82 
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:47,844 
- Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe. 
- That's awful! 

83 
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,011 
Look at that pollution. 

84 
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:56,810 
Do me a favor, will you? 

85 
00:10:57,694 --> 00:10:59,728 
Call this telephone number. 

86 
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:01,641 
Police Department? 

87 
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,531 
Tell them Inspector Callahan 
thinks there's a... 

88 
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:07,969 
...two-eleven in progress 
at the bank. Got it? 

89 
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:10,648 
Got it. 

90 
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:14,009 
Be sure and tell them 
it's in progress, right? 

91 
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:16,926 
In progress. 
Yes, sir. 

92 
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:25,721 
Now, if they'll just wait 
till the cavalry arrives. 

93 
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,771 
Shit! 

94 
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:44,166 
Halt! 

95 
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,441 
I know what you're thinking. 

96 
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:10,887 
Did he fire six shots or only five? 

97 
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:15,078 
To tell the truth, in the excitement 
I kind of lost track myself. 

98 
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:18,446 
This is a.44 Magnum, the most 
powerful handgun in the world... 

99 
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:20,884 
...and would blow 
your head clean off... 

100 
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:25,202 
...you've got to ask yourself 
one question: "Do I feel lucky?" 

101 
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:27,007 
Well, do you, punk? 

102 
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,998 
I got to know. 

103 
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:09,161 
Son of a bitch! 

104 
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:15,322 
It looks like we can save that leg. 

105 
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:17,398 
I've got a couple under my knee. 

106 
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:19,319 
Ever consider 
another line of work? 

107 
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:21,878 
I really appreciate this, Steve. 

108 
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,476 
We Potrero Hill boys 
have to stick together. 

109 
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:26,279 
Nothing fancy, now. 

110 
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:29,963 
Just a little tweezers 
and Mercurochrome. 

111 
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:33,085 
Do I tell you how to beat a confession 
out of a prisoner? 

112 
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:37,444 
- I haven't got all night. 
- You might experience discomfort. 

113 
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:41,162 
But if you do, 
just have your wife fix a... 

114 
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,399 
Sorry, Harry. 

115 
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:46,235 
- What will you do with those? 
- Cut your pants off. 

116 
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:49,605 
- No. We'll pull them off. 
- It'll hurt. 

117 
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,235 
For $29.50, let it hurt. 

118 
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:54,920 
You can turn your back 
if you're embarrassed. 

119 
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:16,559 
- Good morning, inspector. 
- Maria. 

120 
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:24,559 
You wanted to see me, lieutenant? 

121 
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:30,638 
When the hell 
you going to get a haircut? 

122 
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:32,680 
Whenever you do. 

123 
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,836 
Who's got time? I was up till 3 a.m. 
Checking the search patterns. 

124 
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:40,234 
- Put in for overtime. 
- That'll be the day. 

125 
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:42,599 
You made a good pinch. 
Chief was pleased. 

126 
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:45,835 
- He was? 
- He said to say, "Well done!" 

127 
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:47,994 
I can't tell you how moved I am. 

128 
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:50,199 
I pass along a compliment... 

129 
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:54,152 
...you could be a little polite. 
It might not kill you to say thanks. 

130 
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:56,280 
I'd rather say thanks to a raise. 

131 
00:16:56,525 --> 00:17:00,641 
Harry, check communications. 
Something from Chicago. A gun nut. 

132 
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,716 
- I'll get right on it. 
- Now wait a minute! 

133 
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:05,396 
I'm putting somebody 
with you. 

134 
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:13,797 
- What are you talking about? 
- You need a partner. 

135 
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:17,435 
- What's wrong with the one I've got? 
- He's in the hospital! 

136 
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:21,119 
- He'll be out in a few weeks. 
- Say hello to Chico Gonzales. 

137 
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:23,882 
- He'll be working with you. 
- You must be kidding. 

138 
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:26,158 
I have no time to break in newcomers. 

139 
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:29,474 
- Why don't you do this boy a favor? 
- What do you mean? 

140 
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:33,756 
You know what happens to guys I worked 
with. Deitzick's in the hospital... 

141 
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:35,236 
...and Fanduchi's dead. 

142 
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:36,676 
So? 

143 
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:41,273 
If I need a partner, I'll get me one 
who knows what he's doing. 

144 
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:42,671 
What about De Georgio? 

145 
00:17:42,924 --> 00:17:44,150 
No way! 

146 
00:17:44,404 --> 00:17:46,472 
You work with Gonzales 
or you don't work. 

147 
00:17:46,724 --> 00:17:48,678 
Straight from the fifth floor. 
Got it? 

148 
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:52,670 
I got it. 

149 
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:59,551 
If you see De Georgio, 
send him in here! 

150 
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,440 
You from around here? 

151 
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,717 
Yeah, but I went to San Jose State. 

152 
00:18:04,963 --> 00:18:08,271 
- Play ball? 
- No, I boxed. Light heavyweight. 

153 
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:11,319 
Just what I need is a college boy. 

154 
00:18:11,562 --> 00:18:15,314 
- Found anything you like about me yet? 
- It's early yet. 

155 
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,676 
- Get your degree? 
- Sociology. 

156 
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:21,310 
Sociology! You'll go far, if you live. 

157 
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:22,669 
I intend to. 

158 
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:24,996 
Inspector Callahan. 

159 
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:28,789 
Don't let your degree get you killed. 
I'm liable to get killed with you. 

160 
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,268 
I'll remember that. 

161 
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:35,269 
- Hero! Nice work yesterday. 
- Fatso! Bressler wants to see you. 

162 
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:38,269 
You're a sweet man, Harry. 

163 
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:45,554 
There is one question, 
Inspector Callahan. 

164 
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:47,871 
Why do they call you Dirty Harry? 

165 
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:49,838 
That's one thing about our Harry. 

166 
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:51,274 
Doesn't play favorites. 

167 
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:55,877 
Harry hates everybody: Limeys, micks, 
hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks. 

168 
00:18:56,522 --> 00:18:57,589 
You name it. 

169 
00:18:57,842 --> 00:19:01,628 
- How does he feel about Mexicans? 
- Ask him! 

170 
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,237 
Especially spics. 

171 
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:51,994 
Hey! There's a guy 
on the roof over there! 

172 
00:21:52,197 --> 00:21:54,072 
On Stockton Street 
by Washington Square. 

173 
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:18,509 
You, on the roof! 

174 
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:20,462 
You, there! 

175 
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:22,346 
Yes, you. 
Stop what you're doing. 

176 
00:22:22,596 --> 00:22:25,233 
Turn around 
and put your hands in the air. 

177 
00:22:42,556 --> 00:22:44,943 
I don 't know 
how the helicopter boys lost him! 

178 
00:22:45,315 --> 00:22:48,066 
How could they let him get out 
without seeing him? 

179 
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:51,942 
They were probably talking instead of 
looking, like they were supposed to. 

180 
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:53,751 
That's possible. 

181 
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:04,031 
- Attention, all units. 
- Turn that thing up louder. 

182 
00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:08,789 
Prowler last seen 
in the vicinity of Washington Square. 

183 
00:23:09,035 --> 00:23:10,102 
He is an adult male. 

184 
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:13,868 
Caucasian. Repeat, 
adult male Caucasian. 

185 
00:23:14,115 --> 00:23:16,308 
When last seen, 
he was wearing tan chinos... 

186 
00:23:16,515 --> 00:23:20,222 
... pale blue shirt, brown coat 
or sweater, dark gloves. 

187 
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:21,747 
He had a tan suitcase... 

188 
00:23:21,995 --> 00:23:26,066 
... which probably contains a 
30-06 rifle. He's wanted... 

189 
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:29,589 
Those loonies! They ought to throw 
a net over the whole bunch! 

190 
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:31,632 
I know what you mean. 

191 
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,466 
- There! 
- What? 

192 
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:38,311 
Tan suitcase. 

193 
00:23:38,674 --> 00:23:40,867 
- Where? 
- I lost him. 

194 
00:23:42,914 --> 00:23:44,391 
There he goes, over there. 

195 
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:45,906 
Does that bag look tan? 

196 
00:23:46,114 --> 00:23:48,307 
I don't know, 
I haven't even seen him yet. 

197 
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:50,184 
Go to Filbert and hang a left. 

198 
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:51,945 
Look out for these people! 

199 
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:55,184 
- Fruitcake! 
- Get out of the way, hammerhead! 

200 
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:02,388 
It was a tan suitcase. 
I know it was. 

201 
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:05,702 
I saw him. 

202 
00:24:05,953 --> 00:24:07,509 
- There he is. 
- I see him. 

203 
00:24:10,233 --> 00:24:11,949 
Car 2, the license number... 

204 
00:24:12,193 --> 00:24:14,910 
... at 10-32 on that Chevrolet, 
Colorado plates. 

205 
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:23,786 
- How do you want to work this? 
- Find another entrance. I'll go here. 

206 
00:24:23,993 --> 00:24:26,824 
Car 2, what's the model 
of that Chevrolet? 

207 
00:24:29,673 --> 00:24:32,310 
Car 2. It's an Impala convertible. 

208 
00:24:32,952 --> 00:24:34,099 
10-4. 

209 
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:48,702 
You can cancel that 10-25. 
Three cars here. 

210 
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:12,388 
Anybody home? 

211 
00:25:36,391 --> 00:25:38,539 
- I brought you a nice present. 
- Let me see it. 

212 
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:58,142 
It's beautiful! Why don't you go get 
a nice container of egg rolls? 

213 
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:04,908 
You getting an eyeful? 

214 
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:07,265 
You goddamn pie hawker! 

215 
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,783 
- We should call the police. 
- I am a police... 

216 
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,019 
Up against the wall. 
Right now! Move. 

217 
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:26,577 
- Let them go. 
- Let them go? 

218 
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,381 
- You heard me. 
- They assaulted a police officer. 

219 
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:32,659 
A police officer! 
He was standing on a can peeking in... 

220 
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:34,744 
...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend! 

221 
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:36,346 
Beat it. Get out of here. 

222 
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:43,899 
- How about the man with the suitcase? 
- Wrong number. 

223 
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:46,944 
I just had another thought. 

224 
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,586 
Yeah? About what? 

225 
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:51,182 
About why 
they call you Dirty Harry. 

226 
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,379 
Inspector 71. 

227 
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:04,820 
Inspector 71. 
Please respond to your call. 

228 
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:08,102 
Inspector 71. 
Do you read me? 

229 
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:12,063 
- This is Inspector 71. 
- I've got an 8-0-4 in progress. 

230 
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:14,867 
California Hall 
at Polk and Turk streets. 

231 
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:16,824 
10-4. We're on our way. 

232 
00:27:37,028 --> 00:27:38,254 
It's some idiot. 

233 
00:27:38,628 --> 00:27:40,503 
Where? I don't see him. 

234 
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:43,345 
- There he is. 
- Yeah. Now I see him. 

235 
00:27:45,188 --> 00:27:48,781 
I have a 10-29 and a 10-28. 

236 
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:52,143 
In 600 block of Baker. 
On a Chevrolet. 

237 
00:27:52,388 --> 00:27:56,982 
California license D-dog, 
C- Charles, V-Victor 4-7-2. 

238 
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:09,099 
We thought it was your sniper, but 
it turned out to be a suicide attempt. 

239 
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:26,216 
- Anybody try to talk him down? 
- Yeah, no luck. But now you're here... 

240 
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:29,137 
- You mean, I go up. 
- We'd sure appreciate it. 

241 
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:40,414 
Don't you try to get me! 

242 
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:45,133 
Not me. You're the one who 
wants to get yourself killed. Not me. 

243 
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:49,259 
Always happens with you guys. 
The last minute you want to... 

244 
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:54,293 
...grab onto somebody, take somebody 
with you. Down you go. Not me! 

245 
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:56,456 
Won't you try to grab me? 

246 
00:29:57,825 --> 00:30:02,339 
A friend of mine was up about 20 
floors with a jumper a few years ago. 

247 
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:04,692 
The jumper grabbed him 
and they went off. 

248 
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:05,931 
Mashed all over. 

249 
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:10,221 
Couldn't tell which legs was 
with which, which arms with which... 

250 
00:30:10,424 --> 00:30:13,619 
It was a terrible mess. 
I tell you, I almost threw up myself. 

251 
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:17,298 
- I'd just like your name and address. 
- Why? 

252 
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:21,610 
It's a mess down there afterwards! 
It makes identification impossible. 

253 
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,897 
Even if they find 
your driver's license! 

254 
00:30:24,143 --> 00:30:25,460 
All that blood! 

255 
00:30:28,823 --> 00:30:31,096 
I think I'm going to puke! 

256 
00:30:31,383 --> 00:30:34,851 
Don't do that, son. All those people 
down there looking up. 

257 
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:37,894 
The fire chief looking up. 
With his face... 

258 
00:30:38,543 --> 00:30:39,690 
You bastard! 

259 
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:27,129 
Get the stretcher up here. 

260 
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,580 
Now you know why I'm called 
Dirty Harry. 

261 
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:44,135 
Every dirty job that comes along. 

262 
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,378 
Inspector 71. 

263 
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:01,771 
This is Inspector 71. 

264 
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:06,376 
Got something for you. Corner of 
Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro. 

265 
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:09,649 
What about him? 

266 
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:12,533 
Shot in the face. 
Blew part of it away. 

267 
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:16,336 
Anybody know who the boy is? 

268 
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:18,615 
His name was Charlie Russell. 

269 
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,411 
I'm his mother. 

270 
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,010 
He's only 10 years old. 

271 
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,858 
Inspector, this officer... 
Oh, Jesus Christ! 

272 
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,168 
You'd better go check on the mother. 

273 
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,246 
What do you have? 

274 
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:58,413 
That 30-06 shell casing. 

275 
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,375 
He was up here all right. 

276 
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,370 
Welcome to Homicide. 

277 
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:28,930 
The man who designed blue serge 
uniforms for police departments... 

278 
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:31,328 
...has to sell these for a living! 

279 
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:37,927 
.458 Magnum? 

280 
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:42,734 
- This thing will stop an elephant. 
- Yeah. 

281 
00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:47,450 
- Apparently you like a little edge. 
- All I can get, sir. 

282 
00:33:47,698 --> 00:33:50,733 
He's no elephant, Harry. 
He's no animal of any kind. 

283 
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:52,534 
What have you got, lieutenant? 

284 
00:33:52,778 --> 00:33:56,974 
The blue flags represent the units that 
will be on duty by dark tonight. 

285 
00:33:57,218 --> 00:33:59,366 
- Double shifts and overtime. 
- At nighttime. 

286 
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:02,289 
Daylight, the helicopters 
will keep him off the roofs. 

287 
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:06,449 
We're going for high visibility. Units 
will make themselves very noticeable. 

288 
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:09,130 
- Except here. 
- Right. The North Beach area. 

289 
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:10,968 
We're saving that for him. 

290 
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,690 
- Have you found a good stakeout? 
- I think so. 

291 
00:34:13,938 --> 00:34:17,849 
It's a building that overlooks the 
roof where they spotted him yesterday. 

292 
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,014 
Something bothering you? 

293 
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:23,966 
- Nothing. 
- Speak up. You're among friends here. 

294 
00:34:24,177 --> 00:34:27,167 
It seems a long shot 
that he'd come back to the same roof. 

295 
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:30,452 
There are a lot of rooftops 
in San Francisco. 

296 
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:34,044 
Most of them are locked. 
This particular one'll be open for him. 

297 
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:38,005 
These sick guys have behavior patterns. 

298 
00:34:38,256 --> 00:34:41,929 
We know they'll rob the very 
same store 3, 4 times in a row. 

299 
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:44,563 
Must appeal to their 
superego or something. 

300 
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,044 
Scorpio strikes again. 

301 
00:34:47,576 --> 00:34:49,565 
They like that feeling. 

302 
00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:53,250 
There's one other reason 
why he might pick the same rooftop. 

303 
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:56,406 
He's got a clear view 
of the St. Peter and Paul's Church. 

304 
00:34:56,656 --> 00:34:58,690 
And they're having a novena tonight. 

305 
00:34:58,936 --> 00:35:00,447 
Go on. 

306 
00:35:00,896 --> 00:35:03,852 
The note. He threatened 
to kill a priest or a Negro. 

307 
00:35:04,096 --> 00:35:05,652 
The Russell boy was black. 

308 
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:09,489 
He may just figure 
he owes himself a padre. 

309 
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:26,045 
Inspector 71. 

310 
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:29,568 
We're in position 
to start our surveillance. 

311 
00:35:52,495 --> 00:35:53,642 
How about the priest? 

312 
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:57,050 
- He knows he's being set up for bait? 
- Yeah, he wanted to. 

313 
00:35:58,295 --> 00:36:01,126 
We told him we had a volunteer 
willing to take his place. 

314 
00:36:01,615 --> 00:36:02,762 
Who? 

315 
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:05,602 
Never guess. 

316 
00:36:06,135 --> 00:36:09,125 
Yeah, I know. 
Welcome to Homicide. 

317 
00:37:36,532 --> 00:37:39,886 
You owe it to yourself 
to live a little, Harry. 

318 
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:55,805 
Son of a bitch took the bait! 

319 
00:37:56,932 --> 00:37:59,922 
When I say "now," 
hit him with the light. 

320 
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,044 
Now! 

321 
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:22,118 
- You all right? 
- I think so. 

322 
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:16,199 
Call an ambulance. 

323 
00:40:17,568 --> 00:40:19,363 
Collins never knew what hit him. 

324 
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:26,684 
Let's go. Clear the alley. 
There's nothing to see. 

325 
00:40:26,888 --> 00:40:29,081 
Call headquarters. 
He's loose in North Beach. 

326 
00:41:14,326 --> 00:41:16,360 
It's a whole new ball game, fellows. 

327 
00:41:17,246 --> 00:41:19,633 
He grabbed a 14-year-old girl. 

328 
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:22,359 
Ann Mary Deacon. 

329 
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:26,074 
The bomb squad got a call. 
Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park. 

330 
00:41:26,326 --> 00:41:30,761 
It was addressed to the mayor. The lab 
sent it to us, with this letter inside. 

331 
00:41:31,006 --> 00:41:32,722 
"Ann Mary Deacon, buried alive." 

332 
00:41:32,966 --> 00:41:36,240 
The poor kid went to the movies 
last night and never came home. 

333 
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:40,196 
"Double-crossing San Francisco police 
made me do this. 

334 
00:41:40,446 --> 00:41:43,993 
Now ransom $200,000, 
in used tens and twenties. 

335 
00:41:44,566 --> 00:41:45,963 
One man with yellow bag. 

336 
00:41:46,205 --> 00:41:48,922 
South side Marina. 
Green East Harbor. 

337 
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:50,516 
9 p.m. 

338 
00:41:50,805 --> 00:41:52,839 
She has oxygen 
till 3 a.m. Tomorrow. 

339 
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:55,597 
Red panties and bra. Nice tits. 

340 
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:59,478 
Mole on left thigh. Anything cute 
and you'll force me to let girl die... 

341 
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:02,197 
...of slow suffocation. 
Signed, Scorpio." 

342 
00:42:04,645 --> 00:42:05,598 
Anything else? 

343 
00:42:07,285 --> 00:42:09,513 
The mother identified the bra... 

344 
00:42:09,765 --> 00:42:11,321 
...the hank of hair... 

345 
00:42:11,685 --> 00:42:12,798 
...and that. 

346 
00:42:13,045 --> 00:42:14,601 
The dentist identified that. 

347 
00:42:16,525 --> 00:42:18,832 
Said it was pulled out 
with a pair of pliers. 

348 
00:42:20,845 --> 00:42:21,912 
You know she's dead. 

349 
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:26,361 
All I know is the letter says 
she'll be alive until 3 a.m. 

350 
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:30,913 
The mayor's out trying to 
put the money together now. 

351 
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:33,276 
He's using up a lot of favors. 

352 
00:42:35,364 --> 00:42:36,875 
He wants to pay. 

353 
00:42:38,524 --> 00:42:40,001 
No tricks. 

354 
00:42:45,843 --> 00:42:47,718 
We need a bag man. 
You want the job? 

355 
00:42:49,843 --> 00:42:50,717 
You got it. 

356 
00:42:50,963 --> 00:42:53,919 
- Be in the chief's office at 6 p.m. 
- All right. 

357 
00:42:54,163 --> 00:42:56,675 
- Wait a minute. What about me? 
- You're out. 

358 
00:42:56,923 --> 00:42:58,593 
No cover? 
Not even one man? 

359 
00:43:00,843 --> 00:43:02,194 
Sure that's how to do it? 

360 
00:43:02,403 --> 00:43:05,234 
I'm not sure! 
But those are my orders. All right? 

361 
00:43:07,203 --> 00:43:11,353 
No wonder they call him Dirty Harry. 
He gets the shit end of the stick. 

362 
00:43:11,603 --> 00:43:14,274 
One more word and you're 
chopped off at the ankles. 

363 
00:43:15,123 --> 00:43:18,079 
Al, let's split the difference. 
Give him the night off. 

364 
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:21,071 
Get the hell out of here, 
both of you. 

365 
00:43:32,003 --> 00:43:34,071 
Testing 1, 2, 3... 

366 
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:37,552 
- What are you yelling for? 
- All you have to do is whisper. 

367 
00:43:38,002 --> 00:43:40,639 
"Mary had a little lamb, 
its fleece as white as snow." 

368 
00:43:40,842 --> 00:43:42,398 
Okay, that's better. 

369 
00:43:42,602 --> 00:43:45,433 
It's good for 2 or 3 blocks. 
But in a tunnel... 

370 
00:43:45,642 --> 00:43:46,993 
...forget it. 

371 
00:43:47,282 --> 00:43:49,316 
All right, Sid. 
What do I owe you? 

372 
00:43:49,562 --> 00:43:51,630 
Bring it back in one piece. 

373 
00:43:55,642 --> 00:43:57,312 
$200,000. 

374 
00:43:57,562 --> 00:43:59,471 
Count it and sign for it. 

375 
00:44:01,962 --> 00:44:03,837 
Did you count it out? 

376 
00:44:06,242 --> 00:44:07,992 
Did you count it, chief? 

377 
00:44:09,642 --> 00:44:11,835 
It's not my responsibility. 

378 
00:44:13,922 --> 00:44:17,276 
Always knew I'd get rich 
on the police force. 

379 
00:44:19,762 --> 00:44:23,070 
Just make sure 
nobody takes it away from you. 

380 
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:29,868 
God knows how he'll contact you. 
He'll probably run you all over town. 

381 
00:44:30,121 --> 00:44:32,394 
Go where you're told. 
Do what you're told. 

382 
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:35,637 
Play it straight down the line. Okay? 

383 
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,513 
Nothing cute. 
Nothing fancy. 

384 
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,909 
Just pay the ransom money 
and report back here. 

385 
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,431 
Would you mind if I borrowed 
a little Scotch tape? 

386 
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,353 
It's disgusting that a police officer 
should know how to use that weapon. 

387 
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:14,912 
- You got a yellow suitcase? 
- Yeah, I got it right with me. 

388 
00:46:18,118 --> 00:46:20,266 
- What's your name? 
- Callahan. 

389 
00:46:20,518 --> 00:46:23,030 
- What are you? 
- Police officer. 

390 
00:46:24,518 --> 00:46:25,869 
Hello? 

391 
00:46:36,158 --> 00:46:38,067 
All right, police officer... 

392 
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:40,068 
... this is how we play. 

393 
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:44,313 
I bounce you all over town 
to make sure you're alone. 

394 
00:46:44,837 --> 00:46:47,793 
If I even think you're being followed, 
the girl dies. 

395 
00:46:48,037 --> 00:46:51,994 
If you talk to anyone, even if it's 
a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost... 

396 
00:46:52,317 --> 00:46:53,668 
... the girl dies. 

397 
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:56,873 
- Is the girl okay? 
- Just shut up and listen. 

398 
00:46:57,157 --> 00:46:58,383 
No car. 

399 
00:46:58,877 --> 00:47:02,390 
I give you some time 
to go from phone booth to phone booth. 

400 
00:47:02,597 --> 00:47:06,065 
I ring 4 times. 
You don 't answer by the fourth ring... 

401 
00:47:06,317 --> 00:47:08,226 
... that's the end of the game. 

402 
00:47:08,717 --> 00:47:10,194 
The girl dies. 

403 
00:47:10,437 --> 00:47:12,232 
What time you got? 

404 
00:47:13,196 --> 00:47:16,345 
- 9:30. Now listen... 
- You listen. 

405 
00:47:17,036 --> 00:47:18,547 
I'm watching you. 

406 
00:47:19,156 --> 00:47:22,624 
Not all the time, 
but you'll never know when or where. 

407 
00:47:23,676 --> 00:47:27,872 
Now get to Forest Hills Station 
as fast as you can. Understand? 

408 
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:36,307 
- Yeah. 
- I hope you're not stupid. 

409 
00:48:16,075 --> 00:48:17,472 
Downstairs. 
Take the "K" car. 

410 
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:21,308 
Get off at Church and 20th. 
Hurry up, or you'll blow it. 

411 
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,747 
You sound like you had a good rest. 

412 
00:50:23,992 --> 00:50:27,619 
You'll need it. I'm going to give you 
a nice little run this time. 

413 
00:50:27,832 --> 00:50:31,106 
You better make it, 
because if you don 't, dead girl! 

414 
00:50:31,352 --> 00:50:34,422 
Public phone, 
hamburger stand, Aquatic Park. 

415 
00:50:36,552 --> 00:50:39,542 
Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard. 

416 
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,620 
What's in the bag, man? 

417 
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,899 
- You dudes get lost now, you hear? 
- Screw the bag! 

418 
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,467 
Just give us the wallet. 

419 
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:24,740 
You don't listen, do you, asshole? 

420 
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:53,344 
Don't answer that! 

421 
00:52:02,109 --> 00:52:06,385 
- Who picked it up? 
- Some old guy. Never saw him before. 

422 
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:12,664 
Chico, he hung up. 

423 
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:17,262 
- You know Mt. Davidson Park? 
- Yeah. 

424 
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,701 
Go to the cross. 

425 
00:52:56,227 --> 00:52:58,420 
I'm at the entrance 
on Lansdale Street. 

426 
00:52:59,387 --> 00:53:01,341 
I'm going up. 

427 
00:53:15,147 --> 00:53:17,101 
I see a couple of people. 

428 
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:22,097 
Just a couple of kids necking. 

429 
00:53:22,347 --> 00:53:24,654 
Boys or girls? 

430 
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:44,580 
I'm Callahan. 

431 
00:53:46,706 --> 00:53:48,456 
My friends call me Alice. 

432 
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:50,423 
And I will take a dare. 

433 
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:54,417 
When was the last time 
you were busted? 

434 
00:53:54,906 --> 00:53:57,862 
If you're a vice, I'll kill myself. 

435 
00:53:58,346 --> 00:53:59,663 
Well, do it at home. 

436 
00:55:00,704 --> 00:55:01,737 
Freeze! 

437 
00:55:02,744 --> 00:55:04,494 
Just like a statue. 

438 
00:55:05,424 --> 00:55:06,855 
That's right. 

439 
00:55:07,544 --> 00:55:10,375 
One wrong move, 
anything, I don't care. 

440 
00:55:10,624 --> 00:55:13,182 
I'll kill you and the girl both. 

441 
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:15,141 
Understand? 

442 
00:55:16,624 --> 00:55:17,737 
Yeah. 

443 
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:20,497 
Drop the bag. 

444 
00:55:23,983 --> 00:55:25,255 
Left hand. 

445 
00:55:25,783 --> 00:55:27,339 
Let's see the gun. 

446 
00:55:32,703 --> 00:55:33,816 
My! 

447 
00:55:34,263 --> 00:55:35,853 
That's a big one. 

448 
00:55:37,303 --> 00:55:39,178 
Left hand. Throw it. 

449 
00:55:40,423 --> 00:55:41,615 
Easy. 

450 
00:55:45,823 --> 00:55:47,095 
Raise your hands. 

451 
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,013 
Come on, get them up. 

452 
00:55:52,703 --> 00:55:53,850 
Now turn. 

453 
00:55:54,103 --> 00:55:55,819 
Face the cross. 

454 
00:55:58,303 --> 00:55:59,370 
Come on. 

455 
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:02,294 
Put your nose right up 
against the cement. 

456 
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:27,333 
You lift that hand once more and I 
won't let you know where the girl is! 

457 
00:56:27,662 --> 00:56:29,491 
Do we understand each other? 

458 
00:56:30,422 --> 00:56:31,694 
Do we understand each other? 

459 
00:56:32,982 --> 00:56:34,971 
Don't pass out on me yet! 
No, no. 

460 
00:56:35,222 --> 00:56:36,778 
No, no. Not yet. Not yet! 

461 
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:39,090 
Don't pass out on me yet, 
you rotten oinker! 

462 
00:56:40,182 --> 00:56:42,535 
Do we understand each other? 

463 
00:56:43,302 --> 00:56:47,737 
If you care what happens to the girl, 
you'd better answer me! All right? 

464 
00:56:47,982 --> 00:56:49,129 
Listen to me carefully. 

465 
00:56:50,182 --> 00:56:51,818 
I've changed my mind. 

466 
00:56:52,382 --> 00:56:53,972 
I'm going to let her die. 

467 
00:56:55,862 --> 00:56:58,010 
I just wanted you to know that. 

468 
00:57:02,221 --> 00:57:06,610 
You understand? I just wanted to make 
sure you knew that before I killed you. 

469 
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,097 
Goodbye, Callahan! 

470 
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,856 
Chico, don't kill him! 

471 
00:59:18,177 --> 00:59:21,406 
The hospital report on Gonzales 
looks okay, chief. 

472 
00:59:21,697 --> 00:59:23,925 
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid. 

473 
00:59:24,457 --> 00:59:25,729 
He's right here. 

474 
00:59:25,977 --> 00:59:27,488 
He's got two cracked ribs. 

475 
00:59:27,737 --> 00:59:30,408 
They want to do some more tests 
on him in the morning. 

476 
00:59:30,657 --> 00:59:33,692 
The son of a bitch really 
kicked him a couple of beauts. 

477 
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,129 
I'm sending him home. 

478 
00:59:35,377 --> 00:59:36,649 
Right, chief. 

479 
00:59:37,737 --> 00:59:39,407 
He says beat it! That's an order. 

480 
00:59:41,497 --> 00:59:44,885 
The chief wants to know 
if I misunderstood his orders. 

481 
00:59:45,137 --> 00:59:48,605 
Meaning, am I just plain stupid 
or did I deliberately disobey him? 

482 
00:59:48,857 --> 00:59:50,925 
He wants to know 
what Gonzales was doing there. 

483 
00:59:51,177 --> 00:59:53,689 
He wants to know 
why we screwed everything up. 

484 
00:59:53,936 --> 00:59:55,572 
What am I going to tell him? 

485 
00:59:58,016 --> 01:00:00,244 
Why don't you start 
by telling him the truth? 

486 
01:00:00,856 --> 01:00:03,926 
Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders 
from a superior. Me. 

487 
01:00:04,136 --> 01:00:06,694 
Tell him you didn't know 
anything about it. 

488 
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,244 
When this is over, if he wants 
my badge, he can have that too. 

489 
01:00:12,216 --> 01:00:14,808 
You wouldn't have a belt of booze 
around here, would you? 

490 
01:00:21,616 --> 01:00:23,605 
Lieutenant Bressler's office. 

491 
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:28,330 
- Put him on. 
- What is it? 

492 
01:00:28,976 --> 01:00:33,968 
It's Park Emergency. They just treated 
a guy who had a knife wound in the leg. 

493 
01:00:35,656 --> 01:00:38,532 
Yeah, Doctor? 
What'd this guy look like? 

494 
01:00:39,056 --> 01:00:40,806 
Long blond hair... 

495 
01:00:41,056 --> 01:00:43,887 
...medium build, about 150 pounds. 

496 
01:00:44,496 --> 01:00:45,643 
Pale complexion. 

497 
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:49,330 
- He didn't give you his name, Doc? 
- Nope. 

498 
01:00:50,415 --> 01:00:52,051 
They usually give a phony name. 

499 
01:00:53,455 --> 01:00:55,364 
But I've seen him someplace. 

500 
01:00:55,895 --> 01:00:59,852 
It's important you remember. There's 
a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating. 

501 
01:01:00,095 --> 01:01:02,004 
I'm trying to think! 

502 
01:01:02,255 --> 01:01:03,572 
It was... 

503 
01:01:04,335 --> 01:01:05,971 
I believe he works around here. 

504 
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:09,131 
Doctor, could you give 
him something? He's in pain! 

505 
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,964 
Yes, just a moment. 

506 
01:01:15,054 --> 01:01:16,451 
She'll be dead in an hour! 

507 
01:01:16,694 --> 01:01:18,648 
I'm trying to remember! 

508 
01:01:20,934 --> 01:01:22,763 
I've got who he is. 

509 
01:01:23,574 --> 01:01:27,645 
When they had football, 
he used to sell programs at the stadium. 

510 
01:01:28,254 --> 01:01:30,846 
I think the groundskeeper 
lets him live there. 

511 
01:01:31,094 --> 01:01:33,652 
- Live where? 
- There. 

512 
01:01:38,454 --> 01:01:40,010 
Kezar Stadium. 

513 
01:02:41,852 --> 01:02:43,886 
Illegal entry. No warrant. 

514 
01:02:44,212 --> 01:02:45,882 
Looks like we climb. 

515 
01:02:47,212 --> 01:02:48,643 
Too much linguine. 

516 
01:02:50,772 --> 01:02:52,408 
I'll find another way. 

517 
01:06:01,447 --> 01:06:02,434 
Stop! 

518 
01:06:21,566 --> 01:06:24,636 
Don't do anything more! 
You tried to kill me! 

519 
01:06:25,966 --> 01:06:27,079 
You need any help? 

520 
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:32,443 
- Go on and get some air, fatso. 
- Please! No more! 

521 
01:06:32,846 --> 01:06:36,234 
Can't you see I'm hurt? 
You shot me! Please, don't! 

522 
01:06:36,766 --> 01:06:38,834 
Let me have a doctor! 

523 
01:06:39,086 --> 01:06:41,518 
Please, get me the doctor! 
Don't kill me! 

524 
01:06:42,046 --> 01:06:43,557 
The girl, where is she? 

525 
01:06:43,806 --> 01:06:44,919 
You tried to kill me! 

526 
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:49,157 
If I did, your head would be splattered 
all over this field. Where's the girl? 

527 
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:50,519 
I want a lawyer. 

528 
01:06:50,726 --> 01:06:52,555 
I said, where's the girl? 

529 
01:06:52,886 --> 01:06:55,921 
- I have the right for one. 
- Where's the girl? 

530 
01:06:57,126 --> 01:06:59,274 
I have the right to a lawyer! 

531 
01:07:00,206 --> 01:07:01,603 
Don't! Please! 

532 
01:07:01,846 --> 01:07:04,278 
I have rights. I want a lawyer! 

533 
01:08:38,763 --> 01:08:40,991 
Harry Callahan. 
He said it was urgent. 

534 
01:08:41,243 --> 01:08:45,075 
Yes, the district attorney has 
been wanting to talk to you. 

535 
01:08:45,363 --> 01:08:48,433 
- It's Inspector Callahan. 
- Have him come in, please. 

536 
01:08:49,443 --> 01:08:51,557 
Won't you come this way? 

537 
01:08:51,963 --> 01:08:55,237 
- May I bring you in a cup of coffee? 
- No, thanks. 

538 
01:09:03,562 --> 01:09:05,278 
I'll be done in a minute. 

539 
01:09:06,002 --> 01:09:07,319 
Have a seat. 

540 
01:09:11,562 --> 01:09:14,916 
I've just been looking over 
your arrest report. 

541 
01:09:16,442 --> 01:09:19,671 
A very unusual piece of police work. 

542 
01:09:21,362 --> 01:09:22,588 
Really amazing. 

543 
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:24,993 
I had some luck. 

544 
01:09:25,241 --> 01:09:28,868 
You're lucky I'm not indicting you for 
assault with intent to commit murder! 

545 
01:09:32,441 --> 01:09:36,318 
Where does it say you've got a right 
to kick down doors, torture suspects? 

546 
01:09:36,561 --> 01:09:40,347 
Deny medical attention and legal 
counsel? Where have you been? 

547 
01:09:41,081 --> 01:09:43,673 
Does Escobedo ring a bell? 
Miranda? 

548 
01:09:45,401 --> 01:09:48,197 
You must have heard 
of the 4th Amendment! 

549 
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:52,312 
What I'm saying is, 
that man had rights. 

550 
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,391 
I'm all broken up 
about that man's rights. 

551 
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,828 
You should be. 
I've got news for you. 

552 
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,632 
When he's well enough 
to leave the hospital, he walks. 

553 
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,351 
What are you talking about? 

554 
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,713 
He's free! 

555 
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,837 
You're letting him go? 

556 
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,796 
We have to. 
We can't try him. 

557 
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,232 
And why is that? 

558 
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,356 
Because I'm not wasting 
1/2 million tax dollars... 

559 
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,748 
...on a trial we can't possibly win. 

560 
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,632 
The problem is, 
we don't have any evidence. 

561 
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,631 
- What do you call that? 
- I call it nothing. 

562 
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,227 
Zero. 

563 
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,227 
You're saying that Ballistics can't 
match the bullet up to this rifle? 

564 
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,356 
It does not matter 
what Ballistics can do! 

565 
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,511 
This rifle might make a nice souvenir. 

566 
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,026 
- But it's inadmissible as evidence! 
- Who says? 

567 
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,393 
It's the law. 

568 
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,517 
Then the law is crazy! 

569 
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,356 
This is Judge Bannerman 
of the appellate court. 

570 
01:10:46,559 --> 01:10:51,233 
He holds classes in constitutional 
law. I've asked him for an opinion. 

571 
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:52,512 
Your Honor? 

572 
01:10:53,759 --> 01:10:58,387 
In my opinion, the search 
of the suspect's quarters was illegal. 

573 
01:10:58,599 --> 01:11:02,636 
Evidence obtained thereby, such as 
that hunting rifle for instance... 

574 
01:11:02,839 --> 01:11:04,668 
...is inadmissible in court. 

575 
01:11:04,919 --> 01:11:08,705 
You should have gotten 
a search warrant. I'm sorry. 

576 
01:11:08,919 --> 01:11:12,068 
- It's that simple. 
- Search warrant? A girl was dying! 

577 
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:15,235 
She was, in fact, dead 
according to the medical report! 

578 
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:16,592 
But I didn't know that! 

579 
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:21,787 
The court would recognize the officer's 
legitimate concern for the girl... 

580 
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:26,070 
...but there is no way they can 
possibly condone police torture. 

581 
01:11:26,758 --> 01:11:30,192 
All evidence concerning the girl, 
the suspect's confession... 

582 
01:11:30,438 --> 01:11:31,630 
...physical evidence... 

583 
01:11:31,838 --> 01:11:34,066 
...would have to be excluded. 

584 
01:11:39,718 --> 01:11:41,707 
There must be something 
you can get him on! 

585 
01:11:41,917 --> 01:11:44,793 
Without the evidence 
of the gun and the girl? 

586 
01:11:45,557 --> 01:11:48,194 
I couldn't convict him 
of spitting on the sidewalk! 

587 
01:11:49,837 --> 01:11:52,144 
Now, the suspect's rights... 

588 
01:11:52,397 --> 01:11:54,113 
...were violated... 

589 
01:11:54,357 --> 01:11:56,425 
...under the 4th and 5th... 

590 
01:11:56,677 --> 01:11:59,348 
...and probably the 6th 
and 14th Amendments. 

591 
01:11:59,597 --> 01:12:02,029 
And Ann Mary Deacon, 
what about her rights? 

592 
01:12:02,277 --> 01:12:05,233 
She's raped and left in a hole to die! 
Who speaks for her? 

593 
01:12:05,477 --> 01:12:06,954 
The district attorney's office! 

594 
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:09,553 
If you'll let us. 

595 
01:12:11,157 --> 01:12:15,068 
I have a wife and 3 kids. I don't want 
him on the streets any more than you do. 

596 
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,067 
He won't be out there long. 

597 
01:12:17,317 --> 01:12:19,385 
What is that supposed to mean? 

598 
01:12:19,837 --> 01:12:22,713 
Sooner or later he will stub his toe 
and I'll be there. 

599 
01:12:22,917 --> 01:12:25,509 
This office won't stand 
for any harassment! 

600 
01:12:26,157 --> 01:12:30,228 
You're crazy if you think you've heard 
the last of him. He will kill again. 

601 
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:32,028 
How do you know? 

602 
01:12:33,277 --> 01:12:34,947 
Because he likes it. 

603 
01:14:56,433 --> 01:14:58,103 
You sure you weren't tailed? 

604 
01:14:58,633 --> 01:14:59,780 
Yeah. 

605 
01:15:23,472 --> 01:15:25,620 
You really want $200 worth. 

606 
01:15:26,672 --> 01:15:28,501 
Every penny of it. 

607 
01:15:42,231 --> 01:15:43,628 
Might as well be comfortable. 

608 
01:15:44,311 --> 01:15:45,867 
Go on, sit. 

609 
01:15:53,271 --> 01:15:54,702 
Relax. 

610 
01:15:55,871 --> 01:15:57,746 
Take it easy. 

611 
01:15:58,111 --> 01:16:00,339 
It's going to be all right. 

612 
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:42,138 
You sure you want the rest of it? 

613 
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:44,540 
Every penny's worth! 

614 
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:49,338 
You black son of a bitch! 

615 
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:12,502 
This one's on the house. 

616 
01:17:26,509 --> 01:17:28,020 
That's got to be him. 

617 
01:17:30,509 --> 01:17:34,466 
Are you claiming that the 
San Francisco Police did this to you? 

618 
01:17:34,709 --> 01:17:36,538 
I swear it. As God is my judge. 

619 
01:17:36,789 --> 01:17:38,823 
Why are they harassing you? 

620 
01:17:39,068 --> 01:17:40,977 
They tried to frame me with the murder. 

621 
01:17:41,228 --> 01:17:43,979 
And now they're trying to murder me. 
And look at me! 

622 
01:17:44,228 --> 01:17:48,219 
I'm innocent until proven guilty 
and look at what they did to me. 

623 
01:17:48,508 --> 01:17:51,543 
Everywhere I go cops follow me. 
And just look at me! 

624 
01:17:52,108 --> 01:17:54,939 
Just a minute, nurse. 
Let me ask him one more question. 

625 
01:17:55,148 --> 01:17:57,102 
Did you see who did this to you? 

626 
01:17:57,348 --> 01:17:58,461 
Can you identify him? 

627 
01:17:58,748 --> 01:18:03,137 
His name is Callahan. He's a big cop. 
Works Homicide. Callahan. 

628 
01:18:05,507 --> 01:18:08,497 
Now, that's the rerun 
from the 4 o'clock news. 

629 
01:18:08,747 --> 01:18:11,578 
Since then he's given 
a statement to The Chronicle. 

630 
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:15,216 
He claims you've been following him. 
And beat him up. 

631 
01:18:16,147 --> 01:18:17,863 
What about it, Harry? 

632 
01:18:18,747 --> 01:18:21,134 
- You want my star? 
- I want an answer. 

633 
01:18:21,387 --> 01:18:23,057 
Have you been following him? 

634 
01:18:24,627 --> 01:18:27,981 
Yeah, I've been following him 
on my own time. 

635 
01:18:28,387 --> 01:18:30,535 
- Anybody can tell I didn't do that. 
- How? 

636 
01:18:31,067 --> 01:18:33,863 
Because he looks 
too damn good, that's how! 

637 
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:37,185 
Before I let you go, 
let's get one thing straight. 

638 
01:18:37,427 --> 01:18:40,019 
I don't want any more surveillance! 

639 
01:18:40,947 --> 01:18:42,617 
Neither does he. 

640 
01:18:44,507 --> 01:18:45,540 
What does that mean? 

641 
01:18:47,267 --> 01:18:48,823 
Good night, sir. 

642 
01:18:52,547 --> 01:18:54,217 
Go ahead. Try them. 

643 
01:18:54,747 --> 01:18:58,181 
- Guy makes them where I always eat. 
- Thank you. 

644 
01:18:58,426 --> 01:19:00,984 
I talked to Bressler 
about being on with me. 

645 
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:04,504 
So you know you got a spot 
when you get out. 

646 
01:19:05,146 --> 01:19:08,102 
I don't know 
if I am coming back, Harry. 

647 
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:14,136 
Doing a lot of thinking 
about it and... 

648 
01:19:16,066 --> 01:19:19,215 
I have a teaching credential. 
And I figure... 

649 
01:19:19,906 --> 01:19:21,815 
...what for? You know? 

650 
01:19:25,066 --> 01:19:27,862 
- Time for therapy. 
- You hang in there now. 

651 
01:19:33,626 --> 01:19:35,694 
See you tomorrow. Same time? 

652 
01:19:57,624 --> 01:20:00,261 
- It's my fault, you know. 
- What? 

653 
01:20:00,864 --> 01:20:03,137 
His leaving. 
I thought I could take it. 

654 
01:20:03,384 --> 01:20:04,815 
No class. 

655 
01:20:05,544 --> 01:20:07,658 
- Don't ever say that. 
- What? 

656 
01:20:07,904 --> 01:20:09,699 
Don't ever low-rate yourself. 

657 
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:13,777 
What I meant was, whatever it takes 
to be a cop's wife... 

658 
01:20:14,024 --> 01:20:15,978 
...I'm just not sure I'm making it. 

659 
01:20:16,224 --> 01:20:18,656 
He really tries, 
and all these bastards... 

660 
01:20:18,904 --> 01:20:21,132 
..."pig" this and "pig" that. 

661 
01:20:22,304 --> 01:20:25,931 
But maybe it's when I watch him 
walk out that door at night. 

662 
01:20:26,184 --> 01:20:27,376 
And I think... 

663 
01:20:28,504 --> 01:20:30,857 
...what if it's the last time 
I see him? 

664 
01:20:31,904 --> 01:20:33,494 
Am I the only one? 

665 
01:20:33,784 --> 01:20:35,659 
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy? 

666 
01:20:35,944 --> 01:20:37,011 
No. 

667 
01:20:38,104 --> 01:20:40,172 
You mean she got used to it? 

668 
01:20:40,664 --> 01:20:42,380 
No, she never did, really. 

669 
01:20:42,624 --> 01:20:43,850 
What, then? 

670 
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,021 
She's dead. 

671 
01:20:46,743 --> 01:20:48,413 
Please, forgive me. 

672 
01:20:49,063 --> 01:20:52,133 
She was driving home 
and a drunk crossed the center line. 

673 
01:20:52,383 --> 01:20:53,780 
No reason for it, really. 

674 
01:20:54,623 --> 01:20:56,771 
- I'm so sorry. 
- That's okay. 

675 
01:20:57,503 --> 01:20:59,093 
I want you to tell Chico... 

676 
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:02,057 
...that I understand him quitting. 

677 
01:21:02,303 --> 01:21:05,338 
I think he's right. 
This is no life for you two. 

678 
01:21:05,943 --> 01:21:08,978 
- Why do you stay in it, then? 
- I don't know. 

679 
01:21:10,543 --> 01:21:11,894 
I really don't. 

680 
01:21:47,661 --> 01:21:49,809 
Let me have a fifth of Seagram's. 
Please. 

681 
01:21:51,221 --> 01:21:53,050 
What the hell happened to you? 

682 
01:21:53,301 --> 01:21:55,176 
My wife's brother. 

683 
01:21:55,421 --> 01:21:56,488 
I hit her... 

684 
01:21:56,741 --> 01:21:58,331 
...so he hit me. 

685 
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:00,012 
Several times. 

686 
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:02,898 
$5.69. 

687 
01:22:04,821 --> 01:22:07,777 
You're the guy 
that's been robbed all these times. 

688 
01:22:08,021 --> 01:22:10,374 
14 times the last 3 years. 

689 
01:22:10,621 --> 01:22:13,497 
Last 2 times, I sent them 
out of here on platters. 

690 
01:22:13,741 --> 01:22:16,207 
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot. 

691 
01:22:17,301 --> 01:22:20,974 
And I always keep it right here. 
Right where it's handy. 

692 
01:22:21,181 --> 01:22:23,568 
Please, I scare easy. 

693 
01:22:26,701 --> 01:22:29,293 
Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer! 

694 
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:05,413 
Goodbye. 

695 
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:08,376 
See you tomorrow. 

696 
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,492 
Everybody out who gets out here? 

697 
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:22,331 
School bus inspector. 

698 
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,052 
One minute. 
I'm not allowed to have anybody... 

699 
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:26,816 
I'm authorizing it, so go. 

700 
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,816 
What are you doing? 
I don't know you. 

701 
01:23:29,059 --> 01:23:33,175 
Hear me, old hag. Drive or I'll 
decorate this bus with your brains. 

702 
01:23:35,179 --> 01:23:38,647 
- Where? 
- Just get started. I'll tell you where. 

703 
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:44,696 
Let's have some fun now. 

704 
01:23:45,059 --> 01:23:46,410 
Who knows a song? 

705 
01:23:46,579 --> 01:23:49,535 
Everybody knows a song. You? 
You must know a beautiful one. 

706 
01:23:49,978 --> 01:23:51,728 
Come on, sing for us. 

707 
01:25:30,856 --> 01:25:34,608 
- Millie, this is Inspector Callahan. 
- The Mayor is waiting for you. 

708 
01:25:38,736 --> 01:25:41,202 
- What's up? 
- Another note from our boy. 

709 
01:25:41,456 --> 01:25:45,413 
- Who's he grabbed now? 
- That's the trouble, we don't know yet. 

710 
01:25:47,496 --> 01:25:50,167 
The jet must be fueled and 
ready to go in half an hour. 

711 
01:25:50,696 --> 01:25:53,572 
Skeleton crew. 
They must be volunteers. 

712 
01:25:54,135 --> 01:25:55,930 
Tell them the man is dangerous. 

713 
01:25:56,175 --> 01:25:59,802 
I'll read you this note which 
was delivered at 8:00 this morning. 

714 
01:26:00,135 --> 01:26:01,486 
"To the City of San Francisco. 

715 
01:26:01,695 --> 01:26:04,127 
You double-crossed me 
for the last time. 

716 
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:08,889 
I'm warning you to have my $200,000 
in a jet airplane ready and waiting. 

717 
01:26:09,615 --> 01:26:13,208 
I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00 
and tell you about the hostages... 

718 
01:26:13,454 --> 01:26:15,920 
...who I will be happy to kill 
if you don't do... 

719 
01:26:16,174 --> 01:26:18,447 
...exactly what I say. Scorpio." 

720 
01:26:21,294 --> 01:26:23,283 
Better have somebody standing by! 

721 
01:26:23,534 --> 01:26:25,363 
I don't think it's a false alarm. 

722 
01:26:25,574 --> 01:26:27,722 
There's a call for you on line 2. 

723 
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:30,287 
I think it's the one 
you've been waiting for. 

724 
01:26:36,654 --> 01:26:39,405 
- It's the Mayor. 
- I got 7 kids from Park Street School. 

725 
01:26:41,814 --> 01:26:42,961 
I got the bus and... 

726 
01:26:43,214 --> 01:26:46,568 
Come on, honey, now back in the bus. 
That's a good girl. 

727 
01:26:46,814 --> 01:26:48,564 
I got the bus driver. 
Here she is. 

728 
01:26:48,934 --> 01:26:50,285 
Just tell him. 

729 
01:26:50,734 --> 01:26:52,131 
Not my fault, he had a gun... 

730 
01:26:52,334 --> 01:26:53,208 
Just your name! 

731 
01:26:57,094 --> 01:26:58,491 
This is Marcella Platt. 

732 
01:27:00,294 --> 01:27:02,726 
You can check if you want. 
But I don 't see any point. 

733 
01:27:02,974 --> 01:27:04,451 
I'm not bullshitting. 

734 
01:27:04,654 --> 01:27:07,644 
It's simple. I got the kids. 
You start screwing around... 

735 
01:27:07,853 --> 01:27:09,364 
... the kids start dying. 

736 
01:27:09,573 --> 01:27:13,041 
- The plane ready? 
- It's being fueled, and ready to go. 

737 
01:27:13,253 --> 01:27:15,924 
The money will be there 
by the time you get there. 

738 
01:27:16,133 --> 01:27:19,168 
Listen carefully. 
I will drive along nice and easy. 

739 
01:27:19,413 --> 01:27:21,288 
Just me and a busload of kids. 

740 
01:27:21,613 --> 01:27:24,683 
I'll turn off at Sir Francis Drake 
on my way to Santa Rosa Airport. 

741 
01:27:24,933 --> 01:27:26,683 
I don 't want any police cars... 

742 
01:27:26,893 --> 01:27:28,006 
... helicopters, whatever. 

743 
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:32,284 
If you play this game by the rules, 
the kids will have a nice plane ride. 

744 
01:27:32,493 --> 01:27:34,209 
Where are you going? 

745 
01:27:34,813 --> 01:27:37,848 
I'll tell the pilot 
when I get on. No alerts. 

746 
01:27:39,693 --> 01:27:42,728 
I guarantee you, you will not 
be molested in any way. 

747 
01:27:42,973 --> 01:27:44,484 
I give you my word of honor. 

748 
01:27:45,773 --> 01:27:47,602 
Marcella Platt. It checks. 

749 
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:53,801 
Willing to take the money to him? 

750 
01:27:54,093 --> 01:27:58,164 
When will you stop messing around with 
this guy? He has to be stopped now! 

751 
01:27:58,492 --> 01:28:01,323 
He's got a busload of kids 
and I can't take that chance. 

752 
01:28:01,931 --> 01:28:04,762 
I gave my word of honor 
and he will not be molested! 

753 
01:28:04,971 --> 01:28:06,561 
And that's a direct order! 

754 
01:28:08,531 --> 01:28:11,760 
You can just get yourself 
another delivery boy. 

755 
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:43,400 
Where are we going? 

756 
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:47,917 
- This isn't the right way! 
- We're going to the ice cream factory. 

757 
01:29:48,130 --> 01:29:49,959 
Anyone doesn't want to, can get off. 

758 
01:29:50,169 --> 01:29:52,681 
I want to go home to my mother. 

759 
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:54,042 
Go home to your what? 

760 
01:29:54,929 --> 01:29:56,565 
Now, sing! Sing again! 

761 
01:29:58,569 --> 01:30:00,285 
What's the matter? 
Don't you sing? 

762 
01:30:02,008 --> 01:30:04,042 
Are you sick? 
What is it? 

763 
01:30:04,848 --> 01:30:07,314 
Sing or your mothers will die! 

764 
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,160 
I'll kill your mothers! 
And the rest of you! 

765 
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:19,037 
Get in the right-hand lane. 

766 
01:30:19,288 --> 01:30:21,561 
Not right to treat children that way. 

767 
01:30:21,808 --> 01:30:24,161 
- You'll hurt them. 
- Just drive the goddamn bus! 

768 
01:30:24,408 --> 01:30:26,397 
And get in the right-hand lane! 

769 
01:30:33,008 --> 01:30:35,042 
I want my mother. 

770 
01:30:43,048 --> 01:30:44,638 
The sign, Sir Drake Blvd. 

771 
01:30:44,847 --> 01:30:45,880 
Make a right there. 

772 
01:30:46,687 --> 01:30:49,802 
There's a sign to Sir Drake Boulevard! 

773 
01:30:50,447 --> 01:30:52,242 
Not this one. 

774 
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:54,164 
I want my mother. 

775 
01:30:55,407 --> 01:30:56,394 
Shut up! 

776 
01:30:58,367 --> 01:30:59,878 
Just get to the right! 

777 
01:31:14,207 --> 01:31:15,718 
Jesus! 

778 
01:31:23,487 --> 01:31:25,953 
What the hell is he doing up there? 

779 
01:31:30,407 --> 01:31:33,363 
What the hell are you doing? 
Pass the V.W., will you? 

780 
01:34:44,681 --> 01:34:46,192 
Drop the gun, creep! 

781 
01:34:48,921 --> 01:34:50,910 
I'll blow his brains out. 

782 
01:34:54,241 --> 01:34:55,877 
Drop the fucking gun! 

783 
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,036 
I know what you're thinking. 

784 
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:47,594 
You're thinking, 
did he fire 6 shots, or only 5? 

785 
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:51,715 
To tell you the truth, I forgot 
myself, in all this excitement. 

786 
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:56,273 
But being this is a.44 Magnum, the 
most powerful handgun in the world... 

787 
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:59,072 
...and will blow your head 
clean off... 

788 
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,189 
...you've got to ask yourself: 

789 
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,156 
"Do I feel lucky?" 

790 
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,948 
Well, do you, punk? 

791 
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,929
