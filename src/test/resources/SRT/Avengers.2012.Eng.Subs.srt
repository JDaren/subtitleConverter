1
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,000
<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,955
<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

3
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,515
It is on a little world, a human world.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,397
They would wield its power,

5
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,198
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,638
<i>He is ready to lead</i>

7
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,039
<i>and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.</i>

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,875
<i>A world will be his.</i>

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,072
<i>The universe, yours.</i>

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,912
<i>And the humans,</i>
<i>what can they do but burn?</i>

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,595
<i>All personnel,</i>

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,955
<i>the evacuation order</i>
<i>has been confirmed.</i>

13
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,959
How bad is it?

14
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,311
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

15
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,558
Dr Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

16
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,477
NASA didn't authorise Selvig
to go to test phase.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,750
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

18
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,915
Spontaneous event.

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,149
It just turned itself on?

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,349
Where are the energy levels now?

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,630
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,989
How long to get everyone out?

23
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,474
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

24
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,874
Do better.

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,677
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

26
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,199
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,516
If we can't control
the Tesseract's energy,

28
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,950
there may not be
a minimum safe distance.

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,069
I need you to make sure

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,792
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,916
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,758
Until such time as the world ends,

33
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,836
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

34
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,079
Clear out the tech below.

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,669
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

36
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,915
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,435
With me.

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,355
Talk to me, Doctor.

39
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,399
Director.

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,192
Is there anything we know for certain?

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,550
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

42
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,433
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,996
The Tesseract is not only
active, she's behaving.

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,155
I assume you pulled the plug.

45
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,998
She's an energy source.

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,112
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

47
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,355
If she reaches peak level...

48
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,836
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

49
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,359
But we don't have the harness.

50
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,708
My calculations are far from complete.

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,674
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,518
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,152
That can be harmful.

54
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,713
Where's Agent Barton?

55
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,518
The Hawk?

56
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,316
Up in his nest, as usual.

57
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,438
<i>Agent Barton, report.</i>

58
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,395
<i>I gave you this detail</i>

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,033
<i>so you could keep</i>
<i>a close eye on things.</i>

60
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,559
Well, I see better from a distance.

61
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,637
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,116
Doctor, it's spiking again.

63
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,639
No one's come or gone.

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,398
And Selvig's clean.

65
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,795
No contacts, no IMs.

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,998
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,159
"At this end"?

68
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,035
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to
the other end of space, right?

69
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,028
Doors open from both sides.

70
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,034
Not yet.

71
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,152
Sir, please put down the spear.

72
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,995
You have heart.

73
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,753
Please don't.

74
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,629
I still need that.

75
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,239
This doesn't have to get any messier.

76
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,589
Of course it does.

77
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,597
I've come too far for anything else.

78
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,153
I am Loki, of Asgard

79
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,115
and I am burdened with
glorious purpose.

80
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,673
Loki,

81
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,388
brother of Thor.

82
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,955
We have no quarrel with your people.

83
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,993
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

84
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,152
Are you planning to step on us?

85
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,438
I come with glad tidings

86
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,471
of a world made free.

87
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,795
Free from what?

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,274
Freedom.

89
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,314
Freedom is life's great lie.

90
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,796
Once you accept that, in your heart,

91
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,917
you will know peace.

92
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,555
Yeah, you say "peace,"

93
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,512
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

94
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,109
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

95
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,594
This place is about to blow

96
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,358
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

97
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,789
He means to bury us.

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,069
Like the pharaohs of old.

99
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,157
He's right. The portal
is collapsing in on itself.

100
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,476
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

101
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,795
Well, then.

102
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,955
I need these vehicles.

103
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,916
- Who's that?
- They didn't tell me.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,194
<i>Hill!</i>

105
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,828
Do you copy?

106
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,794
<i>Barton has turned.</i>

107
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,039
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

108
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,076
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

109
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,916
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.

110
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,394
<i>Director?</i>

111
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,153
Director Fury, do you copy?

112
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,555
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

113
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,109
I have men down. Hill?

114
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,237
A lot of men still under.

115
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,078
I don't know how many survivors.

116
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,395
<i>Sound a general call.</i>

117
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,238
I want every living soul
not working rescue

118
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,315
looking for that briefcase.

119
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,509
Roger that.

120
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,871
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a Level Seven.

121
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,433
<i>As of right now,</i>

122
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,039
we are at war.

123
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,908
What do we do?

124
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,829
This is not how I wanted this evening
to go.

125
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,518
I know how you wanted this evening
to go.

126
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,755
Believe me

127
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,869
this is better.

128
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,597
Who are you working for?

129
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,473
Lermentov, yes?

130
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,759
Does he think

131
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,078
we have to go through him

132
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,759
to move our cargo?

133
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,317
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

134
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,517
Solohob

135
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,676
a bagman, a front.

136
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,033
Your outdated information betrays you.

137
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,199
The famous Black Widow

138
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,998
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

139
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,877
You really think I'm pretty?

140
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,470
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

141
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,196
to move the tanks.

142
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,634
Tell him he is out.

143
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,598
Well...

144
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,032
...you may have to write it down.

145
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,039
It's for her.

146
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,588
You listen carefully

147
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,188
<i>You're at 1- 14</i>
<i>Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.</i>

148
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,476
<i>We have an F-22</i>
<i>exactly eight miles out.</i>

149
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,197
<i>Put the woman on the phone,</i>
<i>or I will blow up the block</i>

150
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,356
<i>before you can make the lobby.</i>

151
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,596
- <i>We need you to come in.</i>
- Are you kidding? I'm working.

152
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,028
<i>This takes precedence.</i>

153
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,798
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

154
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,678
This moron is giving me everything.

155
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,594
I don't give everything.

156
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,279
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

157
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,355
<i>Natasha...</i>

158
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,313
Barton's been compromised.

159
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,152
Let me put you on hold.

160
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,155
Where is Barton now?

161
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,753
- <i>We don't know.</i>
- But he's alive?

162
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,633
We think so. I'll brief you on
everything when you get back.

163
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,836
But first, we need you to
talk to the big guy.

164
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,998
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.

165
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,556
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

166
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,235
Who are you?

167
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,715
Get out!

168
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,229
There is sickness here!

169
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,315
You're a doctor.

170
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,188
My father's not waking up!

171
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,072
He has a fever and he's moaning

172
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,235
but his eyes won't open.

173
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,315
Slow down.

174
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,835
My father...

175
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,075
Like them?

176
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,114
Please.

177
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,395
You should've got paid
up front, Banner.

178
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,828
You know, for a man

179
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,188
who's supposed to be avoiding stress

180
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,517
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

181
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,316
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

182
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,909
Then what is it? Yoga?

183
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,077
You brought me to the edge of
the city. Smart.

184
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,519
I assume the whole place
is surrounded.

185
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,279
Just you and me.

186
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,436
And your actress buddy?

187
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,517
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

188
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,114
I did.

189
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,309
Who are you?

190
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,589
Natasha Romanoff.

191
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,074
Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?

192
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,874
Because that's not going to
work out for everyone.

193
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,435
No, of course not. I'm here
on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

194
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,553
S.H.I.E.L.D.

195
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,235
How did they find me?

196
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,958
We never lost you, Doctor.

197
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,115
We've kept our distance.

198
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,038
Even helped keep some other
interested parties

199
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,189
off your scent.

200
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,635
Why?

201
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,035
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

202
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,798
But now we need you to come in.

203
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,517
What if I say no?

204
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,756
I'll persuade you.

205
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,952
And what if the other guy says no?

206
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,198
You've been more than a year
without an incident.

207
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,868
I don't think you want to
break that streak.

208
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,514
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

209
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,636
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

210
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,432
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

211
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,716
This

212
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,195
is the Tesseract.

213
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,073
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

214
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,870
What does Fury want me to do,
swallow it?

215
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,435
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

216
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,233
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

217
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,238
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

218
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,113
If there was, that's where I'd be.

219
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,750
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

220
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,154
Not that he's told me.

221
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,430
And he tells you everything?

222
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,399
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

223
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,509
He needs me in a cage?

224
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,595
No one's going to put you in a...

225
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,715
Stop lying to me!

226
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,274
I'm sorry. That was mean.

227
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,270
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

228
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,273
Why don't we do this the easy way

229
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,674
where you don't use that

230
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,634
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

231
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,628
Okay?

232
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,874
Natasha?

233
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,309
Stand down.

234
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,719
<i>We're good here.</i>

235
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,959
"Just you and me."

236
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,508
<i>This is out of line, Director.</i>

237
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,029
<i>You're dealing</i>
<i>with forces you can't control.</i>

238
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,750
You ever been in a war,
Councilman? In a firefight?

239
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,633
Did you feel
an overabundance of control?

240
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,071
<i>You're saying that this Asgard</i>
<i>is declaring war on our planet?</i>

241
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,714
Not Asgard. Loki.

242
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,593
<i>He can't be working alone.</i>
<i>What about the other one?</i>

243
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,709
<i>His brother.</i>

244
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,796
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile

245
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,955
but he's worlds away.

246
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,838
We can't depend on him to help, either.

247
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,915
It's up to us.

248
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,554
<i>Which is why you</i>
<i>should be focusing on Phase 2.</i>

249
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,948
<i>It was designed for exactly this...</i>

250
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,197
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

251
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,919
We need a response team.

252
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,315
<i>The Avengers Initiative was shut down.</i>

253
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,238
This isn't about the Avengers.

254
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,509
<i>We've seen the list.</i>

255
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,836
<i>You're running the world's greatest</i>
<i>covert security network</i>

256
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,518
<i>and you're going to leave</i>
<i>the fate of the human race</i>

257
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,874
<i>to a handful of freaks.</i>

258
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,831
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

259
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,156
We need a response team.

260
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,994
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even

261
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,193
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

262
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,708
<i>You believe?</i>

263
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,356
<i>War isn't won by sentiment, Director.</i>

264
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,237
No, it's won by soldiers.

265
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,798
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

266
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,479
<i>I got to put her in the water!</i>

267
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,629
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

268
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,633
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

269
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,195
<i>This guy is still alive!</i>

270
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,632
Trouble sleeping?

271
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,480
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

272
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,714
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

273
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,039
When I went under,
the world was at war.

274
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,992
I wake up, they say we won.

275
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,159
They didn't say what we lost.

276
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,950
We've made some mistakes
along the way.

277
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,952
Some, very recently.

278
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,589
Are you here with a mission, sir?

279
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,675
I am.

280
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,392
Trying to get me back in the world?

281
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,472
Trying to save it.

282
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,871
HYDRA's secret weapon.

283
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,071
Howard Stark fished that
out of the ocean

284
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,269
when he was looking for you.

285
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,392
He thought what we think.

286
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,599
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

287
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,715
That's something
the world sorely needs.

288
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,275
Who took it from you?

289
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,833
He's called Loki.

290
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,554
He's not from around here.

291
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,991
There's a lot we'll have to
bring you up to speed on

292
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,269
if you're in.

293
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,116
The world has gotten even stranger

294
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,275
than you already know.

295
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,228
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

296
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,432
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

297
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,439
There's a debriefing packet

298
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,835
waiting for you back at your apartment.

299
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,951
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

300
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,229
that we ought to know now?

301
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,715
You should have left it in the ocean.

302
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,873
<i>Good to go on this end.</i>
<i>The rest is up to you.</i>

303
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,354
<i>You disconnected</i>
<i>the transmission lines?</i>

304
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,435
<i>Are we off the grid?</i>

305
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,630
Stark Tower is about to become
a beacon

306
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,199
of self-sustaining clean energy.

307
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,276
<i>Well, assuming</i>
<i>the arc reactor takes over</i>

308
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,549
<i>and it actually works.</i>

309
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,148
<i>I assume.</i>

310
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,595
Light her up.

311
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,875
<i>How does it look?</i>

312
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,600
Like Christmas, but with more me.

313
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,472
<i>We've got to go wider on</i>
<i>the public awareness campaign.</i>

314
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,669
<i>You need to do some press.</i>

315
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,235
<i>I'm in DC tomorrow,</i>

316
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,833
<i>I'm working on the zoning</i>
<i>for the next three buildings.</i>

317
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,116
<i>Pepper, you're killing me.</i>
<i>The moment, remember?</i>

318
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,309
<i>Enjoy the moment.</i>

319
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,635
<i>Get in here and I will.</i>

320
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,638
<i>Sir, Agent Coulson of</i>
<i>S.H.I.E.L.D. Is on the line.</i>

321
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,155
<i>I'm not in.</i>

322
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,028
I'm actually out.

323
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,474
<i>Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.</i>

324
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,319
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

325
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,513
Levels are holding steady, I think.

326
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,790
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

327
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,115
Which brings me to my next question.

328
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,157
How does it feel to be a genius?

329
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,510
Well, I really wouldn't know,
now would I?

330
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,032
What do you mean?
All this came from you.

331
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,710
No, all this came from that.

332
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,115
Give yourself some credit. Please.

333
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,038
Stark Tower is your baby.

334
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,515
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

335
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,029
12%?

336
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,229
An argument can be made for 15.

337
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,873
12%? My baby?

338
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,593
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

339
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,517
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

340
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,910
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

341
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,439
That was on you.

342
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,591
- My private elevator...
- You mean our elevator?

343
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,360
...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.

344
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,790
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

345
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,877
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

346
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,469
It's not going to be that subtle.

347
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,908
I'll tell you what.

348
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,475
The next building is gonna
say "Potts" on the tower.

349
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,999
On the lease.

350
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,916
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

351
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,314
<i>Sir, the telephone.</i>

352
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,795
<i>I'm afraid my protocols</i>
<i>are being overridden.</i>

353
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,877
<i>Mr Stark, we need to talk.</i>

354
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,390
You have reached the life
model decoy of Tony Stark.

355
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,517
- Please leave a message.
- <i>This is urgent.</i>

356
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,438
Then leave it urgently.

357
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,989
Security breach. It's on you.

358
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,794
- Mr Stark.
- Phil! Come in.

359
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,915
"Phil"?

360
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,029
I can't stay.

361
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,389
His first name is "Agent."

362
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,158
Come on in. We're celebrating.

363
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,078
Which is why he can't stay.

364
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,157
We need you to look this over
as soon as possible.

365
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,349
I don't like being handed things.

366
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,959
That's fine, because
I love to be handed things.

367
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,434
So, let's trade.

368
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,193
Thank you.

369
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,476
Official consulting hours
are between 8 and 5

370
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,555
every other Thursday.

371
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,675
This isn't a consultation.

372
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,994
Is this about the Avengers?

373
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,152
Which I know nothing about.

374
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,794
The Avengers Initiative
was scrapped, I thought.

375
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,319
And I didn't even qualify.

376
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,475
I didn't know that either.

377
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,393
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

378
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,714
don't play well with others.

379
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,955
That I did know.

380
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,638
This isn't about personality
profiles any more.

381
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,030
Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?

382
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,195
Half a mo.

383
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,510
You know, I thought we were
having a moment.

384
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,233
I was having 12% of a moment.

385
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,755
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

386
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,837
How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?

387
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,712
What is all this?

388
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,399
This is

389
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,035
this.

390
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,399
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

391
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,509
Tomorrow.

392
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,835
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

393
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,678
Well, what if I didn't?

394
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,599
- Lf you didn't?
- Yeah.

395
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,870
You mean when you've finished?

396
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,071
Well, then...

397
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,308
Square deal. Fly safe.

398
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,429
Work hard.

399
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,872
So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

400
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,719
- I can drop you.
- Fantastic.

401
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,795
I want to hear

402
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,512
about the cellist. Is that still a thing?

403
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,789
She moved back to Portland.

404
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,992
What? Boo!

405
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,029
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

406
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,115
So, this Dr Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

407
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,799
A lot of people were.

408
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,558
You were the world's first superhero.

409
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,834
Banner thought gamma radiation
might hold the key to unlocking

410
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,274
Erskine's original formula.

411
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,599
Didn't really go his way, did it?

412
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,399
Not so much.

413
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,319
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

414
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,714
He's like a smart person.

415
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,829
I gotta say,

416
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,469
it's an honour to meet you officially.

417
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,633
I've sort of met you. I mean,

418
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,518
I watched you while you were sleeping.

419
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,396
I mean, I was present

420
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,751
while you were
unconscious from the ice.

421
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,155
You know, it's really just a huge honour

422
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,157
to have you on board this...

423
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,317
I hope I'm the man for the job.

424
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,273
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

425
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,233
We made some modifications
to the uniform.

426
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,873
I had a little design input.

427
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,274
The uniform?

428
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,869
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

429
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,274
old-fashioned?

430
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,150
With everything that's happening

431
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,918
and the things that are about
to come to light,

432
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,070
people might just need
a little old-fashioned.

433
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,113
The Chitauri grow restless.

434
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,958
Let them gird themselves.

435
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,798
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

436
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,115
Battle?

437
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,878
Against the meagre might of Earth?

438
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,799
Glorious, not lengthy.

439
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,629
If your force
is as formidable as you claim.

440
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,229
You question us?

441
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,476
You question him,

442
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,995
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

443
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,998
Who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose

444
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,953
when you were cast out, defeated?

445
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,957
I was a king!

446
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,276
The rightful king of Asgard,

447
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,715
betrayed.

448
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,874
Your ambition is little

449
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,719
and born of childish need.

450
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,831
We look beyond the Earth

451
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,873
to the greater worlds
the Tesseract will unveil.

452
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,673
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

453
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,315
I don't threaten.

454
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,268
But until I open the doors,

455
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,950
until your force is mine to command,

456
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,398
you are but words.

457
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,388
You will have your war, Asgardian.

458
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,031
If you fail,

459
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,198
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

460
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,598
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

461
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,951
no crevice where he cannot find you.

462
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,119
You think you know pain?

463
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,758
He will make you long
for something sweet as pain.

464
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,749
Stow the captain's gear.

465
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,835
Yes, sir.

466
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,312
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

467
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,748
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

468
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,875
They need you on the bridge.

469
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,433
They're starting the face-trace.

470
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,675
See you there.

471
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,319
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

472
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,068
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

473
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,033
Did he ask you to sign
his Captain America trading cards yet?

474
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,389
Trading cards?

475
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,670
They're vintage. He's very proud.

476
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,588
Dr Banner.

477
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,748
Yeah, hi.

478
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,429
They told me you would be coming.

479
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,868
Word is, you can find the Cube.

480
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,677
Is that the only word on me?

481
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,195
Only word I care about.

482
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,160
It must be strange for you, all of this.

483
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,400
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

484
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,068
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

485
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,919
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

486
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,599
<i>Flight crew, secure the deck.</i>

487
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,433
Is this a submarine?

488
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,915
Really?

489
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,635
They want me in a submerged,
pressurised, metal container?

490
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,235
No, no, this is much worse.

491
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,434
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

492
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,949
Increase collective to 8.0%.

493
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,035
Preparing for maximum
performance takeoff.

494
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,593
Increase output to capacity.

495
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,796
Power plant performing at capacity.

496
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,399
We are clear.

497
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,033
All engines operating.

498
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,677
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

499
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,354
- We are at level, sir.
- Good.

500
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,675
Let's vanish.

501
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,189
Engage retro-reflection panels.

502
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,435
Reflection panels engaged.

503
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,359
Gentlemen.

504
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,269
Doctor, thank you for coming.

505
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,997
Thanks for asking nicely.

506
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,714
So, how long am I staying?

507
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,638
Once we get our hands on
the Tesseract,

508
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,909
you're in the wind.

509
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,792
Where are you with that?

510
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,672
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible

511
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,755
camera on the planet.

512
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,038
Cell phones, laptops...

513
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,711
If it's connected to a satellite,
it's eyes and ears for us.

514
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,114
That's still not gonna find them in time.

515
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,275
You have to narrow your field.

516
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,357
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

517
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,118
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know.

518
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,958
Tell them to put
the spectrometers on the roof

519
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,479
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

520
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,752
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

521
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,349
At least we could rule out a few places.

522
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,318
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

523
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,629
Agent Romanoff,

524
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,950
could you show Dr Banner
to his laboratory, please?

525
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,190
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

526
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,438
Put it over there.

527
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,396
Where did you find all these people?

528
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,433
S.H.I.E.L.D. Has no shortage
of enemies, Doctor.

529
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,915
Is this the stuff you need?

530
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,035
Yeah, iridium.

531
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,714
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

532
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,478
It's very hard to get hold of.

533
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,159
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
Knows you need it.

534
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,679
Well, I didn't know.

535
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,029
Hey!

536
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,435
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

537
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,711
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

538
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,795
I know.

539
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,431
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

540
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,713
My next target.

541
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,835
Tell me what you need.

542
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,952
I need a distraction.

543
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,193
And an eyeball.

544
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,114
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

545
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,309
No, no. It's fine.

546
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,753
It's a vintage set.

547
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,155
It took me a couple of years
to collect them all.

548
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,635
Near mint.

549
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,159
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

550
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,874
We got a hit. A 67% match.

551
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,918
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

552
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,835
Location?

553
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,912
Stuttgart, Germany. 28 Königstrasse.

554
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,314
He's not exactly hiding.

555
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,589
Captain,

556
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,875
you're up.

557
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,109
Kneel before me.

558
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,628
I said

559
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,710
kneel!

560
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,871
Is not this simpler?

561
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,432
Is this not your natural state?

562
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,712
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

563
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,195
that you crave subjugation.

564
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,349
The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy

565
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,028
in a mad scramble for power,

566
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,119
for identity.

567
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,917
You were made to be ruled.

568
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,078
In the end,

569
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,515
you will always kneel.

570
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,477
Not to men like you.

571
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,311
There are no men like me.

572
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,913
There are always men like you.

573
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,912
Look to your elder, people.

574
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,393
Let him be an example.

575
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,388
You know, the last time
I was in Germany,

576
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,637
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

577
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,239
we ended up disagreeing.

578
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,317
The soldier.

579
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,474
The man out of time.

580
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,234
I'm not the one who's out of time.

581
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,034
<i>Loki, drop the weapon</i>
<i>and stand down.</i>

582
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,073
Kneel.

583
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,553
Not today!

584
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,788
The guy's all over the place.

585
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,390
<i>Agent Romanoff. You miss me?</i>

586
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,840
<i>Make your move, Reindeer Games.</i>

587
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,431
<i>Make your move, Reindeer Games.</i>

588
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,559
<i>Good move.</i>

589
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,228
Mr Stark.

590
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,995
<i>Captain.</i>

591
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,478
<i>Is he saying anything?</i>

592
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,874
Not a word.

593
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,991
<i>Just get him here. We're low on time.</i>

594
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,875
I don't like it.

595
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,117
What, Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

596
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,912
I don't remember it being that easy.

597
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,479
This guy packs a wallop.

598
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,116
Still, you are pretty spry
for an older fellow.

599
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,633
What's your thing, Pilates?

600
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,755
What?

601
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,875
It's like calisthenics.

602
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,956
You might have missed
a couple of things

603
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,718
doing time as a Capsicle.

604
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,073
Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

605
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,033
Yeah, there's a lot of things
Fury doesn't tell you.

606
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,913
Where's this coming from?

607
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,308
What's the matter? Are you
scared of a little lightning?

608
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,915
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

609
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,115
What are you doing?

610
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,919
<i>And now there's that guy.</i>

611
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,792
Another Asgardian?

612
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,752
- That guy's a friendly?
- <i>Doesn't matter.</i>

613
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,428
<i>If he frees Loki or kills him,</i>
<i>the Tesseract's lost.</i>

614
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,392
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

615
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,795
<i>I have a plan. Attack.</i>

616
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,278
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

617
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,435
I don't see how I can.

618
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,154
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

619
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,828
There's only one God, ma'am.

620
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,235
And I'm pretty sure
he doesn't dress like that.

621
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,399
Where is the Tesseract?

622
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,828
I missed you, too.

623
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,640
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

624
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,639
You should thank me.

625
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,036
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

626
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,879
did the Allfather have to
muster to conjure you here

627
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,399
to your precious Earth?

628
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,588
I thought you dead.

629
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,513
Did you mourn?

630
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,678
We all did. Our father...

631
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,798
Your father.

632
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,353
He did tell you
my true parentage, did he not?

633
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,950
We were raised together.

634
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,674
We played together,
we fought together.

635
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,309
Do you remember none of that?

636
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,397
I remember a shadow.

637
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,752
Living in the shade of your greatness.

638
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,954
I remember you tossing me
into an abyss.

639
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,991
I, who was, and should be, king!

640
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,191
So you take the world I love
as a recompense

641
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,072
for your imagined slights?

642
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,238
No. The Earth is under
my protection, Loki.

643
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,990
And you're doing
a marvellous job with that.

644
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,317
The humans slaughter
each other in droves

645
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,158
while you idly fret.

646
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,430
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

647
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,119
You think yourself above them?

648
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,115
Well, yes.

649
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,675
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

650
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,799
A throne would suit you ill.

651
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,439
I've seen worlds
you've never known about!

652
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,633
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

653
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,877
I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract,

654
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,035
and when I wield it...

655
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,912
Who showed you this power?

656
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,314
Who controls the would-be king?

657
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,238
- I am a king!
- Not here!

658
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,668
You give up the Tesseract!

659
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,234
You give up this poisonous dream!

660
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,159
You come home.

661
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,989
I don't have it.

662
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,718
You need the Cube to bring me home.

663
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,070
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

664
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,912
You listen well, brother.

665
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,949
I'm listening.

666
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,312
Do not touch me again.

667
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,033
Then don't take my stuff.

668
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,390
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

669
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,155
Shakespeare in the Park?

670
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,472
Doth Mother know
you wear-eth her drapes?

671
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,359
This is beyond you, metal man.

672
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,596
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

673
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,031
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours. Until then,

674
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,594
<i>stay out of the way.</i>

675
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,638
<i>Tourist.</i>

676
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,789
Okay.

677
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,158
Power at 400% capacity.

678
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,839
How about that?

679
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,829
Hey!

680
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,429
That's enough.

681
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,798
Now, I don't know
what you plan on doing here.

682
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,195
I've come here to put an end
to Loki's schemes.

683
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,834
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

684
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,915
Yeah... No.

685
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,559
<i>Bad call. He loves his hammer.</i>

686
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,230
You want me to put the hammer down?

687
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,072
Are we done, here?

688
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,833
In case it's unclear,

689
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,238
if you try to escape,

690
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,475
if you so much as scratch that glass,

691
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,468
it's 30,000 feet straight down
in a steel trap.

692
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,036
You get how that works?

693
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,514
Ant, boot.

694
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,392
It's an impressive cage.

695
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,794
Not built, I think, for me.

696
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,469
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

697
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,477
Oh, I've heard.

698
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,555
<i>A mindless beast.</i>

699
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,078
<i>Makes play he's still a man.</i>

700
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,270
<i>How desperate are you,</i>

701
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,438
<i>that you call on such</i>
<i>lost creatures to defend you?</i>

702
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,870
<i>How desperate am I?</i>

703
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,798
You threaten my world with war.

704
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,036
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

705
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,869
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

706
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,958
You have made me very desperate.

707
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,991
You might not be glad that you did.

708
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,271
It burns you to have come so close.

709
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,274
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

710
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,156
unlimited power.

711
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,237
And for what?

712
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,520
A warm light for all mankind to share.

713
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,478
A warm light for all mankind to share.

714
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,837
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

715
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,878
Well, let me know if "real power"
wants a magazine or something.

716
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,279
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

717
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,311
Loki's gonna drag this out.

718
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,830
So, Thor, what's his play?

719
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,474
He has an army called the Chitauri.

720
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,478
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

721
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,871
He means to lead them
against your people.

722
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,593
They will win him the Earth,

723
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,438
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

724
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,312
An army

725
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,112
from outer space.

726
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,629
So, he's building another portal.

727
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,114
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

728
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,195
Selvig?

729
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,590
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

730
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,836
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

731
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,433
along with one of ours.

732
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,153
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

733
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,508
He's not leading an army from here.

734
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,358
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

735
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,278
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

736
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,628
You could smell crazy on him.

737
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,512
Have care how you speak.

738
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,156
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

739
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,595
And he is my brother.

740
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,597
He killed 80 people in two days.

741
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,395
He's adopted.

742
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,755
I think it's about the mechanics.

743
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,837
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

744
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,995
It's a stabilising agent.

745
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,388
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

746
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,999
I'll fly you to Portland.

747
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,679
Keep love alive.

748
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,677
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

749
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,592
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

750
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,951
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

751
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,310
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

752
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,829
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

753
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,636
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

754
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,429
That man is playing <i>Galaga.</i>

755
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,671
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

756
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,879
How does Fury even see these?

757
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,995
He turns.

758
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,838
Sounds exhausting.

759
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,995
The rest of the raw materials,

760
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,873
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

761
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,399
The only major component
he still needs

762
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,956
is a power source
of high-energy density.

763
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,277
Something to kick-start the Cube.

764
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,313
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

765
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,475
Last night.

766
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,032
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

767
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,195
Am I the only one who did the reading?

768
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,033
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

769
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,834
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

770
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,439
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

771
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,756
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilise

772
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,029
the quantum tunnelling effect.

773
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,195
Well, if he could do that,

774
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,715
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

775
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,229
Finally, someone who speaks English.

776
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,317
Is that what just happened?

777
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,431
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

778
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,552
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

779
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,478
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

780
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,636
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

781
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,109
Thanks.

782
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,709
Dr Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

783
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,148
I was hoping you might join him.

784
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,475
I would start with that stick of his.

785
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,589
It may be magical,

786
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,948
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

787
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,992
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

788
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,952
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

789
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,673
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

790
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,518
into his personal flying monkeys.

791
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,359
Monkeys? I do not understand.

792
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,435
I do.

793
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,117
I understood that reference.

794
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,274
Shall we play, Doctor?

795
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,118
This way, sir.

796
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,033
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

797
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,151
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

798
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,078
But it's going to take weeks to process.

799
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,429
If we bypass their mainframe

800
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,788
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

801
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,958
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

802
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,957
All I packed was a toothbrush.

803
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,513
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

804
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,676
Top ten floors, all R&D.

805
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,399
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

806
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,989
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

807
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,634
I kind of broke Harlem.

808
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,592
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

809
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,518
No tension, no surprises.

810
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,393
- Hey!
- Nothing?

811
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,555
Are you nuts?

812
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,635
Jury's out.

813
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,829
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

814
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,915
What's your secret?

815
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,439
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

816
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,669
Is everything a joke to you?

817
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,915
Funny things are.

818
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,712
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

819
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,034
isn't funny.

820
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,115
No offence, Doc.

821
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,673
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

822
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,519
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

823
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,108
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

824
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,832
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr Stark.

825
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,393
Do you think I'm not?

826
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,193
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

827
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,992
What isn't he telling us?

828
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,792
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

829
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,594
You think Fury's hiding something?

830
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,757
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

831
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,552
His secrets have secrets.

832
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,113
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

833
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,318
I just want to finish my work here, and...

834
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,395
Doctor?

835
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,875
"A warm light for all mankind."

836
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,991
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

837
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,519
I heard it.

838
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,835
I think that was meant for you.

839
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,353
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

840
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,515
it was still all over the news.

841
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,631
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

842
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,114
building in New York?

843
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,789
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

844
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,229
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

845
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,112
It's just the prototype.

846
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,117
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

847
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,873
That's what he's getting at.

848
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,468
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. Bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

849
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,272
What are they doing
in the energy business

850
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,674
in the first place?

851
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,633
I should probably look into that
once my decryption programme

852
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,830
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

853
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,915
I'm sorry. Did you say...

854
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,951
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

855
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,593
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

856
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,835
S.H.I.E.L.D. Has ever tried to hide.

857
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,915
Blueberry?

858
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,837
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

859
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,679
An intelligence organisation
that fears intelligence?

860
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,313
Historically, not awesome.

861
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,635
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

862
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,273
This is a man who means to start a war

863
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,879
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

864
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,475
We have orders.
We should follow them.

865
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,871
Following's not really my style.

866
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,315
And you're all about style, aren't you?

867
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,429
Of the people in this room,

868
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,073
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

869
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,474
and, B, not of use?

870
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,752
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

871
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,349
Just find the Cube.

872
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,591
That's the guy
my dad never shut up about?

873
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,713
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

874
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,158
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

875
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,952
He does have the jump on us.

876
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,674
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

877
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,552
It's going to blow up in his face.

878
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,875
And I'm going to be there when it does.

879
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,230
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

880
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,508
Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

881
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,476
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

882
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,797
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

883
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,592
It's a nightmare.

884
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,393
I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

885
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,431
to crawl its way into my heart.

886
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,516
This stops it.

887
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,870
This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

888
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,632
not just armour.

889
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,635
It's a terrible privilege.

890
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,235
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

891
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,315
It's different.

892
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,837
Hey, I read all about your accident.

893
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,157
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

894
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,635
So you're saying that the Hulk...

895
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,315
The other guy saved my life?

896
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,869
That's nice.

897
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,349
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

898
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,431
I guess we'll find out.

899
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,672
You may not enjoy that.

900
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,677
And you just might.

901
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,799
<i>As soon as Loki took the doctor,</i>

902
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,592
we moved Jane Foster.

903
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,995
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromsø.

904
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,510
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

905
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,269
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

906
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,109
She'll be safe.

907
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,559
Thank you.

908
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,236
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

909
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,668
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

910
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,869
Erik is a good man.

911
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,955
He talks about you a lot.

912
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,671
You changed his life.

913
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,117
You changed everything around here.

914
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,276
They were better as they were.

915
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,831
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

916
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,509
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

917
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,392
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

918
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,432
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

919
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,918
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

920
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,837
Well, they are repulsive.

921
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,270
And they trample everything
in their path.

922
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,837
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

923
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,190
and your people paid the price.

924
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,038
And now, again.

925
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,835
In my youth, I courted war.

926
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,431
War hasn't started yet.

927
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,238
You think you could make Loki tell us

928
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,588
where the Tesseract is?

929
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,837
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

930
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,476
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

931
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,636
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

932
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,796
A lot of guys think that

933
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,353
until the pain starts.

934
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,993
What are you asking me to do?

935
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,556
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

936
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,669
Loki is a prisoner.

937
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,030
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

938
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,673
that wants to be here?

939
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,718
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

940
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,432
But you figured I'd come.

941
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,593
After.

942
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:11,716
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

943
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,355
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

944
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,872
And I would cooperate.

945
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,911
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

946
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,951
I would say I've expanded his mind.

947
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,271
And once you've won,

948
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,348
once you're king of the mountain,

949
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,789
what happens to his mind?

950
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,718
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

951
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,559
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

952
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,077
Tell me.

953
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,357
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L. D... I...

954
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,434
Well, I made a name for myself.

955
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,438
I have a very specific skill set.

956
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:04,075
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

957
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,396
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

958
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,318
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

959
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,799
He made a different call.

960
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,592
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

961
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,234
Not let you out.

962
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,157
No, but I like this.

963
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,316
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

964
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,431
Regimes fall every day.

965
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,994
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

966
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,075
Or I was.

967
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,912
And what are you now?

968
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,193
It's really not that complicated.

969
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,233
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

970
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,679
Can you?

971
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,589
Can you wipe out that much red?

972
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,438
Dreykov's daughter,

973
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,552
São Paulo,

974
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,949
the hospital fire?

975
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,035
Barton told me everything.

976
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,118
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

977
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,629
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

978
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,079
will change anything?

979
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,760
This is the basest sentimentality.

980
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,030
This is a child at prayer.

981
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,388
Pathetic!

982
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,628
<i>You lie and kill</i>

983
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,672
<i>in the service of liars and killers.</i>

984
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,677
<i>You pretend to be separate,</i>
<i>to have your own code,</i>

985
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,394
<i>something that makes up</i>
<i>for the horrors.</i>

986
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,829
<i>But they are part of you.</i>

987
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,589
<i>And they will never go away.</i>

988
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,516
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

989
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,790
Slowly, intimately,

990
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,195
in every way he knows you fear.

991
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,278
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

992
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,710
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

993
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,832
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

994
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:59,873
You're a monster.

995
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,433
Oh, no.

996
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,793
You brought the monster.

997
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,193
So, Banner.

998
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,315
That's your play.

999
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,429
What?

1000
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,952
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

1001
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,479
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

1002
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,635
Send Thor as well.

1003
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,514
Thank you

1004
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,710
for your cooperation.

1005
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,319
What are you doing, Mr Stark?

1006
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,829
Kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1007
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,757
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

1008
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,393
We are. The model's locked

1009
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,748
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

1010
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:40,835
When we get a hit,

1011
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,837
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1012
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,360
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1013
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,032
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1014
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,229
What is "Phase 2"?

1015
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,079
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. Uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1016
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,872
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1017
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,594
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

1018
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,119
This does not mean that we're making...

1019
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,195
I'm sorry, Nick.

1020
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,515
What were you lying?

1021
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,834
I was wrong, Director.

1022
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:04,949
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1023
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,069
Did you know about this?

1024
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,474
You want to think about
removing yourself

1025
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,874
from this environment, Doctor?

1026
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,070
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1027
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,315
Loki is manipulating you.

1028
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,953
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1029
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,672
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1030
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,869
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1031
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,228
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

1032
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,918
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1033
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,589
Is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

1034
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,269
Because of him.

1035
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,475
Me?

1036
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,675
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

1037
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,837
who had a grudge match
that levelled a small town.

1038
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,076
We learned that
not only are we not alone

1039
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,636
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1040
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,910
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1041
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,917
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

1042
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,917
And you're not the only threat.

1043
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,077
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

1044
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,869
that can't be controlled.

1045
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,069
Like you controlled the Cube?

1046
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,394
Your work with the Tesseract

1047
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,988
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1048
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,439
It is a signal to all the realms

1049
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:00,120
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1050
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,275
A higher form?

1051
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,355
You forced our hand.

1052
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,435
We had to come up with something.

1053
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,515
A nuclear deterrent.

1054
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,551
Because that always
calms everything right down.

1055
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,955
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

1056
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,355
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

1057
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,038
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1058
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,229
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1059
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,157
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

1060
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,033
Excuse me, did we come to
your planet and blow stuff up?

1061
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,957
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

1062
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,479
Are you boys really that naïve?

1063
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,397
S.H.I.E.L.D. Monitors potential threats.

1064
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,748
Captain America's on threat watch?

1065
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,835
We all are.

1066
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,313
Wait, you're on that list?

1067
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,919
Are you above or below angry bees?

1068
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,076
Stark, so help me God,
if you make one more wisecrack...

1069
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,394
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1070
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,909
- Show some respect.
- Respect what?

1071
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,758
<i>Transport Six-Six-Bravo,</i>
<i>please relay confirm codes.</i>

1072
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,950
<i>I've got you on the computer,</i>
<i>but not on the day log.</i>

1073
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,071
<i>What is your haul? Over.</i>

1074
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,714
<i>Arms and ammunition. Over.</i>

1075
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,836
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

1076
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,598
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1077
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,914
I mean, what are we, a team?

1078
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,873
No, we're a chemical mixture
that makes chaos.

1079
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,877
We're a time bomb.

1080
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,752
You need to step away.

1081
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,632
Why shouldn't the guy
let off a little steam?

1082
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,796
You know damn well why. Back off!

1083
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,036
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1084
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,630
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

1085
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,159
Take that off, what are you?

1086
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,510
Genius, billionaire,
playboy, philanthropist.

1087
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,397
I know guys with none of that
worth ten of you.

1088
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,475
I've seen the footage.

1089
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,750
The only thing you really
fight for is yourself.

1090
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,991
You're not the guy
to make the sacrifice play,

1091
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,509
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

1092
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,676
I think I would just cut the wire.

1093
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,316
Always a way out.

1094
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,634
You may not be a threat

1095
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,591
but you better stop pretending
to be a hero.

1096
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,075
A hero? Like you?

1097
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,156
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1098
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,750
Everything special about you
came out of a bottle.

1099
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,719
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1100
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,990
You people are so petty and tiny.

1101
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,075
Yeah, this is a team.

1102
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,394
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1103
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,589
Dr Banner back to his...

1104
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,312
Where? You rented my room.

1105
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,839
The cell was just in case...

1106
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,439
In case you needed to kill me.

1107
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,358
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1108
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,758
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1109
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:50,158
So, I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

1110
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,869
So I moved on.

1111
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,719
I focused on helping
other people. I was good.

1112
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,956
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show

1113
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,399
and put everyone here at risk.

1114
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,511
You want to know my secret,
Agent Romanoff?

1115
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,392
You want to know how I stay calm?

1116
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,150
Dr Banner,

1117
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,194
put down the sceptre.

1118
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,715
Got it.

1119
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,475
Sorry, kids,

1120
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,272
you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

1121
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,355
You located the Tesseract?

1122
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,435
I could get there fastest.

1123
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,596
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.

1124
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,994
- You're not going alone.
- You're gonna stop me?

1125
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,075
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1126
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,428
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1127
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,515
Put on the suit.

1128
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,838
Oh, my God.

1129
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,675
Put on the suit.

1130
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,028
Yeah.

1131
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,352
<i>All hands to stations.</i>

1132
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,038
- Hill!
- <i>External detonation.</i>

1133
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,354
Number three engine is down.

1134
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,435
We've been hit.

1135
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,675
- Can they get it running?
- Fire in engine three!

1136
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,755
Talk to me.

1137
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,438
Turbine looks mostly intact

1138
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,357
but it's impossible to
get out there to make repairs

1139
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,833
while we're in the air.

1140
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,394
If we lose one more engine,
we won't be.

1141
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,431
Somebody's got to get outside
and patch that engine.

1142
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,198
- Stark, you copy that?
- <i>I'm on it.</i>

1143
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,471
<i>Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown</i>
<i>in the detention section</i>

1144
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,555
<i>then get to the armoury.</i>

1145
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,749
Romanoff?

1146
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,639
We're okay.

1147
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,314
We're okay, right?

1148
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,549
- Keep that engine down!
- Yes, sir.

1149
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,318
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1150
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,158
- Got it.
- Stay close.

1151
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,273
Let's go, Level 4.

1152
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,873
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1153
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,835
Doctor?

1154
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,075
Bruce?

1155
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,875
You got to fight it.
This is just what Loki wants.

1156
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,189
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1157
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,275
Are you hurt?

1158
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,556
We're going to be okay. All right?

1159
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,319
I swear on my life,
I will get you out of this.

1160
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,759
You will walk away and never ever...

1161
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,871
Your life?

1162
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,675
Bruce.

1163
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:20,680
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1164
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,069
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1165
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,997
- Take us to the water!
- We're flying blind.

1166
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,031
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

1167
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,832
Is the sun coming up?

1168
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,676
- Yes, sir.
- Then put it on the left.

1169
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,392
Get us over water.

1170
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,511
One more turbine goes down,
and we drop.

1171
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,908
Thanks.

1172
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,235
Stark!

1173
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,432
Stark, I'm here!

1174
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,993
<i>Good.</i>

1175
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,071
<i>Let's see what we've got.</i>

1176
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,792
I got to get this
superconducting coolant system

1177
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:54,875
back online

1178
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,399
before I can access the rotors,

1179
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,272
work on dislodging the debris.

1180
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,199
<i>I need you to get to that</i>
<i>engine control panel</i>

1181
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,835
<i>and tell me which relays</i>
<i>are in overload position.</i>

1182
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,119
<i>What does it look like in there?</i>

1183
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,234
It seems to run
on some form of electricity.

1184
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,032
Well, you're not wrong.

1185
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,959
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1186
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,035
Try to think!

1187
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,557
<i>Okay, the relays are intact.</i>

1188
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,079
What's our next move?

1189
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,155
<i>Even if I clear the rotors,</i>

1190
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,396
<i>this thing won't</i>
<i>re-engage without a jump.</i>

1191
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,839
I'm going to have to
get in there and push.

1192
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,632
If that thing gets up to
speed, you'll get shredded.

1193
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,671
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

1194
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,153
long enough to disengage
maglev and that could...

1195
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,554
Speak English!

1196
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:55,909
You see that red lever?

1197
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,196
<i>It will slow the rotors down</i>
<i>long enough for me to get out.</i>

1198
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,038
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1199
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,198
We need full evac
on the lower hangar bay.

1200
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,269
Grenade!

1201
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,074
<i>We've got a perimeter breach!</i>

1202
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,156
<i>Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. Gear.</i>

1203
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,271
<i>Call-outs at every junction.</i>

1204
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,396
<i>We have the Hulk and Thor</i>
<i>on Research Level 4.</i>

1205
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,999
<i>Levels 2 and 3 are dark.</i>

1206
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,156
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1207
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,275
Get his attention.

1208
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,393
Escort 6-0, proceed to
Wishbone and engage hostile.

1209
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,748
<i>Don't get too close.</i>

1210
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,199
<i>Copy.</i>

1211
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,959
<i>Target acquired.</i>

1212
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,035
<i>Target engaged.</i>

1213
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,679
<i>Target angry, target angry!</i>

1214
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,396
They're not getting through
here, so what the hell...

1215
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,190
<i>Engine one is now in shut-down.</i>

1216
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,350
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1217
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,277
<i>Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.</i>

1218
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,552
<i>It's Barton. He took out our systems.</i>

1219
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:54,069
<i>He's headed for the detention level.</i>

1220
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,077
<i>Does anybody copy?</i>

1221
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,236
This is Agent Romanoff.

1222
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,759
I copy.

1223
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,155
<i>Stark, we're losing altitude.</i>

1224
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,679
Yeah, I noticed.

1225
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,509
No!

1226
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,394
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1227
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,790
The humans think us immortal.

1228
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,319
Should we test that?

1229
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,149
Move away, please.

1230
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,873
You like this?

1231
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,917
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

1232
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,230
Even I don't know what it does.

1233
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,194
Do you want to find out?

1234
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,519
No!

1235
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,553
Natasha?

1236
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,512
You're going to lose.

1237
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,629
Am I?

1238
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,269
It's in your nature.

1239
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,590
Your heroes are scattered.

1240
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:49,269
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1241
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,958
Where is my disadvantage?

1242
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,591
You lack conviction.

1243
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,355
I don't think I'm...

1244
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,560
So, that's what it does.

1245
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,552
<i>All hands</i>
<i>to crash stations immediately.</i>

1246
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,995
Cap, hit the lever.

1247
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,828
I need a minute here!

1248
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:39,995
Lever

1249
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,189
now!

1250
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,749
<i>Help!</i>

1251
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,239
Sorry, boss.

1252
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,998
The god rabbited.

1253
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,519
Just stay awake.

1254
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,198
Eyes on me.

1255
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,799
No, I'm clocking out here.

1256
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,353
Not an option.

1257
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,197
It's okay, boss.

1258
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,996
This was never gonna work

1259
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,348
if they didn't have something

1260
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,119
to...

1261
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,792
<i>Agent Coulson is down.</i>

1262
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,758
<i>A medical team is on</i>
<i>its way to your location.</i>

1263
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,279
<i>They're here.</i>

1264
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,918
<i>They called it.</i>

1265
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,278
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1266
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,516
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

1267
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,472
We're dead in the air up here.

1268
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,558
Our communications,
the location of the Cube,

1269
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,989
Banner, Thor...

1270
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,071
I got nothing for you.

1271
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,998
I lost my one good eye.

1272
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,798
Maybe I had that coming.

1273
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,068
Yes,

1274
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:21,397
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1275
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,631
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1276
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:27,672
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1277
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:35,439
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1278
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:40,437
called the Avengers Initiative.

1279
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,636
The idea was to bring together a group

1280
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,194
of remarkable people

1281
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,679
to see if they could become
something more.

1282
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,993
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1283
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,317
to fight the battles that we never could.

1284
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:05,590
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1285
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,432
In heroes.

1286
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,679
Well,

1287
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,080
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1288
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,949
<i>You fell out of the sky.</i>

1289
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,833
Did I hurt anybody?

1290
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,872
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1291
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,151
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

1292
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:06,949
Lucky.

1293
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:08,638
Or just good aim.

1294
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,273
You were awake when you fell.

1295
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,236
- You saw?
- The whole thing.

1296
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,918
Right through the ceiling.

1297
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:19,828
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1298
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,029
Here.

1299
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,430
Didn't think those would
fit you until you shrunk down

1300
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,869
to a regular-size feller.

1301
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,348
Thank you.

1302
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,514
Are you an alien?

1303
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,229
What?

1304
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:35,794
From outer space, an alien.

1305
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,355
No.

1306
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:40,712
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1307
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,350
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1308
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,551
You know that?

1309
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,157
Is that what you know?

1310
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,273
I've got no window.

1311
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,360
I have to flush him out.

1312
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,992
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

1313
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,599
You don't understand.

1314
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:17,597
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1315
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:22,353
Pull you out
and stuff something else in?

1316
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,675
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

1317
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,435
You know that I do.

1318
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:39,709
Why am I back?

1319
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,119
How did you get him out?

1320
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,959
Cognitive recalibration.

1321
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,674
I hit you really hard on the head.

1322
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,835
Thanks.

1323
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,632
Natasha...

1324
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,315
How many agents did I...

1325
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:57,839
Don't.

1326
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,076
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1327
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,278
This is Loki.

1328
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,914
This is monsters and magic,

1329
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,598
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1330
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,199
Loki, did he get away?

1331
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,275
Yeah.

1332
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,750
I don't suppose you know where.

1333
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,598
I didn't need to know.

1334
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,392
I didn't ask.

1335
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,909
He's going to
make his play soon, though.

1336
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,195
Today.

1337
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,594
We got to stop him.

1338
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,434
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1339
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:27,437
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1340
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,874
Well,

1341
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,590
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

1342
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,314
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1343
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,553
Now you sound like you.

1344
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,639
But you don't.

1345
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,199
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1346
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:51,871
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1347
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,437
What did Loki do to you?

1348
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,469
He didn't. I just...

1349
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,559
Natasha.

1350
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,471
I've been compromised.

1351
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,476
I got red in my ledger.

1352
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,511
I would like to wipe it out.

1353
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:33,313
Was he married?

1354
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,793
No.

1355
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:38,959
There was a cellist, I think.

1356
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:41,833
I'm sorry.

1357
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,112
He seemed like a good man.

1358
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,395
He was an idiot.

1359
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,670
Why? For believing?

1360
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,153
For taking on Loki alone.

1361
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,918
He was doing his job.

1362
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,474
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

1363
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,589
He should have...

1364
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,233
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1365
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,396
Right, I've heard that before.

1366
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,953
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1367
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,798
We are not soldiers.

1368
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,752
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1369
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:09,995
Neither am I.

1370
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:12,236
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

1371
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,679
But right now,
we got to put that behind us

1372
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,916
and get this done.

1373
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:16,995
Loki needs a power source.

1374
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,075
If we can put together a list...

1375
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,155
He made it personal.

1376
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,309
That's not the point.

1377
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,715
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1378
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,671
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1379
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:25,755
To tear us apart.

1380
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,677
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1381
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,155
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

1382
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,759
That's what he wants.

1383
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,269
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1384
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,469
He wants an audience.

1385
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,752
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1386
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:40,678
Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.

1387
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,234
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1388
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,873
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1389
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,629
He wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered...

1390
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,833
Son of a bitch.

1391
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:03,629
Time to go.

1392
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,239
- Go where?
- I'll tell you on the way.

1393
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,315
Can you fly one of those jets?

1394
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,034
I can.

1395
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:13,749
You got a suit?

1396
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:14,835
Yeah.

1397
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,359
Then suit up.

1398
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,108
Hey, you guys aren't
authorised to be in here.

1399
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:46,470
Son, just don't.

1400
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:49,395
Sir.

1401
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:50,669
Agent Hill.

1402
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,679
Those cards,

1403
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:58,998
they were in Coulson's locker,
not in his jacket.

1404
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,753
They needed the push.

1405
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,915
<i>We have an unauthorised departure</i>
<i>from Bay 6.</i>

1406
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:12,034
They found him.

1407
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,389
Get our communications back up,
whatever you have to do.

1408
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,670
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes, sir.

1409
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,352
<i>Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor</i>

1410
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:37,155
<i>but the device</i>
<i>is already self-sustaining.</i>

1411
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:39,350
<i>Shut it down, Dr Selvig.</i>

1412
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,228
It's too late!

1413
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,599
She can't stop now.

1414
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,955
She wants to show us something!

1415
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,036
A new universe.

1416
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,639
<i>Okay.</i>

1417
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,197
<i>The barrier is pure energy.</i>

1418
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,117
<i>It's unbreachable.</i>

1419
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:03,958
<i>Yeah, I got that.</i>

1420
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,075
<i>Plan B.</i>

1421
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,191
<i>Sir, the Mark 7
<i>is not ready for deployment.</i>

1422
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,470
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

1423
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,312
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

1424
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,675
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1425
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,199
You should have left
your armour on for that.

1426
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,673
Yeah.

1427
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:40,835
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1428
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,474
and you've got
the glow stick of destiny.

1429
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,435
Would you like a drink?

1430
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,629
Stalling me won't change anything.

1431
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,796
No, no. Threatening.

1432
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,239
No drink? Are you sure?

1433
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:52,839
I'm having one.

1434
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:57,594
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

1435
01:35:58,440 --> 01:35:59,793
What have I to fear?

1436
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,558
The Avengers.

1437
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,790
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

1438
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,478
"Earth's mightiest heroes"-type thing.

1439
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,397
Yes, I've met them.

1440
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,509
Yeah.

1441
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,755
It takes us a while to get any traction,

1442
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:12,835
I'll give you that one.

1443
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,076
But let's do a head count, here.

1444
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,589
Your brother, the demigod,

1445
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:22,676
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend.

1446
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,837
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

1447
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:28,918
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella,

1448
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,353
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

1449
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,435
That was the plan.

1450
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,471
Not a great plan.

1451
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,556
When they come,

1452
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:39,079
and they will,

1453
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:40,394
they'll come for you.

1454
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:41,475
I have an army.

1455
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,715
We have a Hulk.

1456
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,519
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1457
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,471
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

1458
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:50,434
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

1459
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,790
Maybe your army comes
and maybe it's too much for us,

1460
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,831
but it's all on you.

1461
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,635
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1462
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,792
you can be damn well sure
we'll avenge it.

1463
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,672
How will your friends have time for me

1464
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,518
when they are so busy fighting you?

1465
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:14,629
This usually works.

1466
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,479
Well, performance issues,
it's not uncommon.

1467
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,431
One out of five...

1468
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:21,360
Jarvis, anytime now.

1469
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,635
Jarvis, anytime now.

1470
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,959
You will all fall before me.

1471
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,399
Deploy!

1472
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,873
Deploy!

1473
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,793
<i>And there's one other</i>
<i>person you pissed off.</i>

1474
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,074
<i>His name was Phil.</i>

1475
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,313
Right.

1476
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:27,634
Army.

1477
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,268
Loki!

1478
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,356
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1479
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:41,469
You can't.

1480
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,397
There is no stopping it.

1481
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,238
There is only

1482
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,429
the war.

1483
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,629
So be it.

1484
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,512
<i>Stark, we're on your three,</i>
<i>headed northeast.</i>

1485
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:12,676
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1486
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,438
Swing up Park. I'm going
to lay them out for you.

1487
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,034
<i>Sir, we have more incoming.</i>

1488
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,832
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1489
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,237
- Nat?
- I see him.

1490
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,876
We got to get back up there.

1491
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,712
Stark, are you seeing this?

1492
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,795
<i>Seeing. Still working on believing.</i>

1493
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:23,239
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?

1494
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:24,349
<i>Banner?</i>

1495
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,469
Just keep me posted.

1496
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:28,230
<i>Jarvis, find me a soft spot.</i>

1497
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,197
Look at this!

1498
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,275
Look around you!

1499
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:37,949
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

1500
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,513
It's too late.

1501
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,154
It's too late to stop it.

1502
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:45,989
No. We can, together.

1503
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,356
Sentiment.

1504
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:23,234
We've got civilians
still trapped up here.

1505
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:25,315
Loki.

1506
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,198
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1507
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,317
We got this. It's good. Go.

1508
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:46,759
Do you think you can hold them off?

1509
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:47,835
Captain,

1510
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,479
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1511
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:19,878
Just like Budapest all over again.

1512
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,869
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

1513
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:39,315
It's going to be an hour

1514
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,668
before they can
scramble the National Guard.

1515
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,518
National Guard?

1516
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,873
Does the army know
what's happening here?

1517
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:46,075
Do we?

1518
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,389
You need men in these buildings.

1519
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:49,953
There are people inside and
they're going to be running

1520
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,229
right into the line of fire.

1521
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:53,191
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

1522
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,833
You keep them off the streets.

1523
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:57,474
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1524
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,158
Why the hell
should I take orders from you?

1525
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:13,789
I need men in those buildings.

1526
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,911
Lead the people down
and away from the streets.

1527
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:18,508
We're going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

1528
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:29,993
Well, we got its attention.

1529
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:31,917
<i>What the hell was step two?</i>

1530
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:01,195
What's the story upstairs?

1531
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,151
The power surrounding the Cube
is impenetrable.

1532
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,794
<i>Thor's right. We got</i>
<i>to deal with these guys.</i>

1533
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,478
- How do we do this?
- As a team.

1534
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:08,828
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1535
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:10,349
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1536
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:11,435
Save it.

1537
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:12,834
Loki's going to keep
this fight focused on us,

1538
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,949
and that's what we need.

1539
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,672
Without him,
these things could run wild.

1540
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:18,633
We got Stark up top.
He's going to need us to...

1541
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:29,309
So, this all seems horrible.

1542
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,829
I've seen worse.

1543
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,315
Sorry.

1544
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:35,000
No, we could use a little worse.

1545
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:37,429
- Stark, we got him.
- <i>Banner?</i>

1546
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:38,754
Just like you said.

1547
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:41,474
Then tell him to suit up.
I'm bringing the party to you.

1548
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,671
I don't see how that's a party.

1549
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,155
Dr Banner.

1550
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,558
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

1551
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:04,915
That's my secret, Captain.

1552
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:07,754
I'm always angry.

1553
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:20,318
<i>Hold on!</i>

1554
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,479
Send the rest.

1555
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,154
Guys.

1556
01:47:58,280 --> 01:47:59,429
<i>Call it, Captain.</i>

1557
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,675
All right, listen up.

1558
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:03,473
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

1559
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,874
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1560
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,797
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

1561
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,239
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1562
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:09,475
Anything gets
more than three blocks out,

1563
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,079
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1564
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:12,349
- Can you give me a lift?
- <i>Right.</i>

1565
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,515
<i>Better clench up, Legolas.</i>

1566
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:19,235
Thor, you got to try
and bottleneck that portal.

1567
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,475
Slow them down.

1568
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,670
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

1569
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,438
You and me,
we stay here on the ground.

1570
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:27,549
We keep the fighting here.

1571
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:28,635
And Hulk...

1572
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:32,275
Smash.

1573
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:24,749
Sir.

1574
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:26,715
The Council is on.

1575
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:34,517
Stark, you got a lot of strays
sniffing your tail.

1576
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:38,236
I'm just trying to keep them
off the streets.

1577
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:40,510
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1578
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:41,755
So find a tight corner.

1579
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:43,154
I will roger that.

1580
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:06,315
Oh, boy.

1581
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,598
Nice call.

1582
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:15,869
What else you got?

1583
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,673
<i>Thor is taking on</i>
<i>a squadron down on Sixth.</i>

1584
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,916
And he didn't invite me.

1585
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,358
Captain, none of this
is going to mean a damn thing

1586
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:01,674
if we don't close that portal.

1587
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:03,392
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1588
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,670
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1589
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,397
If you want to get up there,
you're going to need a ride.

1590
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:11,475
I got a ride.

1591
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,549
I could use a boost, though.

1592
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:16,995
Are you sure about this?

1593
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,874
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1594
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,597
Okay, turn, turn.

1595
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:49,392
Less! Less!

1596
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:11,553
<i>Captain, the bank</i>
<i>on 42nd past Madison.</i>

1597
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,352
<i>They've cornered</i>
<i>a lot of civilians in there.</i>

1598
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:15,311
I'm on it.

1599
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:36,318
Everyone! Clear out!

1600
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,592
<i>Director Fury,</i>

1601
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,438
<i>the Council has made a decision.</i>

1602
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:11,199
I recognise the Council
has made a decision.

1603
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:12,833
But given that
it's a stupid-ass decision,

1604
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,313
I have elected to ignore it.

1605
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:17,637
<i>Director, you're closer</i>
<i>than any of our subs.</i>

1606
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:18,715
<i>You scramble that jet...</i>

1607
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:21,434
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

1608
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:23,551
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1609
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:25,557
I will not order a nuclear strike

1610
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:27,073
against a civilian population.

1611
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,509
<i>If we don't hold them here,</i>
<i>we lose everything.</i>

1612
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:32,279
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1613
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:37,518
You.

1614
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:40,795
Hawkeye!

1615
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:43,155
Nat, what are you doing?

1616
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:44,995
A little help?

1617
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:51,035
I got him.

1618
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:17,475
Enough!

1619
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:20,155
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1620
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:22,919
I am a god, you dull creature.

1621
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:24,473
And I will not be bullied by...

1622
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,717
Puny god.

1623
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:44,919
The sceptre...

1624
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:47,189
Doctor.

1625
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,719
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1626
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,432
The Tesseract can't fight,

1627
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:55,516
but you can't protect against yourself.

1628
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:56,595
It's not your fault.

1629
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:57,914
You didn't know what you were doing.

1630
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:02,910
Actually, I think I did.

1631
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:05,873
I built in a safety
to cut their power source.

1632
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,393
Loki's sceptre.

1633
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,988
It may be able to close the portal.

1634
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,070
And I'm looking right at it.

1635
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:30,269
<i>Sir, we will lose power</i>
<i>before we penetrate that shell.</i>

1636
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:39,791
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1637
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,195
<i>I wouldn't consider him a role model.</i>

1638
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,678
<i>Director Fury is no longer in command.</i>

1639
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,756
<i>Override order 7-Alpha- 1- 1.</i>

1640
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:55,348
<i>7- Alpha- 1- 1, confirmed.</i>
<i>We're go for takeoff.</i>

1641
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,191
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1642
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:00,591
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

1643
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:01,948
We need to shut it down!

1644
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,196
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

1645
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,550
Stark, do you hear me?

1646
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:37,716
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

1647
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:39,559
<i>How long?</i>

1648
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:41,671
<i>Three minutes, max.</i>

1649
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:43,358
<i>The payload will wipe out Midtown.</i>

1650
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:45,436
Jarvis, put everything we got
into the thrusters.

1651
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:47,152
<i>I just did.</i>

1652
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:00,794
<i>Package is sent.</i>

1653
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:03,912
<i>Detonation in</i>
<i>2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.</i>

1654
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:28,035
Are you ready for another bout?

1655
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:29,669
What, are you getting sleepy?

1656
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,712
Right at the crown!

1657
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:44,198
I can close it.

1658
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:46,276
Can anybody copy?

1659
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:47,469
I can shut the portal down.

1660
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:49,556
- Do it!
- <i>No, wait.</i>

1661
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:50,874
Stark, these things are still coming.

1662
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:51,955
I got a nuke coming in.

1663
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:53,911
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1664
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:04,952
And I know just where to put it.

1665
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:14,115
<i>Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.</i>

1666
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:15,559
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1667
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:19,593
<i>Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?</i>

1668
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:21,676
Might as well.

1669
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:25,795
<i>The streets of New York City</i>
<i>have become a battleground.</i>

1670
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:28,514
<i>The Army is here trying</i>
<i>to contain the violence</i>

1671
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:30,039
<i>but clearly, it is outmatched.</i>

1672
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:32,355
<i>And I have to say,</i>
<i>in all my years of reporting,</i>

1673
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:35,278
<i>I have never seen anything like this.</i>

1674
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:36,833
<i>We have limited information</i>
<i>on the team</i>

1675
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:40,555
<i>but we do know that</i>
<i>billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...</i>

1676
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:52,632
Come on, Stark.

1677
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,069
Close it.

1678
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:20,275
Son of a gun.

1679
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:26,398
He's not slowing down.

1680
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:45,119
Is he breathing?

1681
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:13,193
What the hell?

1682
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:17,836
What just happened?

1683
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:20,155
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1684
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:25,872
We won.

1685
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:29,348
All right, yay!

1686
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:31,357
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1687
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:34,552
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.

1688
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:36,913
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1689
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:39,515
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1690
02:03:39,640 --> 02:03:41,232
I don't know what it is,
but I want to try it.

1691
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:43,039
We're not finished yet.

1692
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:49,836
And then shawarma after.

1693
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:12,750
If it's all the same to you,

1694
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,512
I'll have that drink now.

1695
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:27,036
<i>Despite the devastation</i>
<i>of what has been confirmed</i>

1696
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:28,798
<i>as an extraterrestrial attack,</i>

1697
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:30,399
<i>the extraordinary heroics</i>

1698

<i>of the group known as the Avengers</i>

1699
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:33,999
<i>has been to many a cause</i>
<i>not only for comfort,</i>

1700
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:35,075
<i>but for celebration.</i>

1701
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:37,509
<i>It's just really great knowing</i>
<i>they're out there.</i>

1702
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:39,358
<i>That someone is watching over us.</i>

1703
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:40,629
<i>I love you, Thor!</i>

1704
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:42,398
<i>And then these guys were like...</i>

1705
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:43,794
<i>And then the air goes...</i>

1706
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:45,239
<i>And this green guy walks up</i>
<i>and he goes...</i>

1707
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:46,349
<i>I don't know.</i>

1708
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:48,835
<i>I don't exactly feel safer</i>
<i>with those things out there.</i>

1709
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:51,918
<i>It just seems that there's</i>
<i>a lot they're not telling us.</i>

1710
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:55,316
<i>Superheroes in New York?</i>
<i>Give me a break.</i>

1711
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,271
<i>These so-called "heroes"</i>

1712
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:58,628
<i>have to be held responsible</i>

1713
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:00,830
<i>for the destruction done to this city.</i>

1714
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,996
<i>This was their fight.</i>
<i>Where are they now?</i>

1715
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:03,600
<i>Tough questions are being asked</i>
<i>about the Avengers themselves.</i>

1716
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:05,830
<i>Tough questions are being asked</i>
<i>about the Avengers themselves.</i>

1717
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:06,915
<i>Their sudden appearance</i>

1718
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:08,359
<i>and equally sudden disappearance...</i>

1719
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:11,153
<i>What, this is all somehow their fault?</i>

1720
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:16,157
<i>Captain America saved my life.</i>

1721
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:21,556
<i>Wherever he is, and</i>
<i>wherever any of them are,</i>

1722
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:23,113
<i>I would just...</i>

1723
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:26,075
<i>I would want to say thank you.</i>

1724
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:29,873
<i>Where are the Avengers?</i>

1725
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,309
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

1726
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:34,510
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

1727
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:36,153
<i>And the Tesseract?</i>

1728
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:38,430
<i>The Tesseract is where it belongs.</i>

1729
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:41,070
<i>Out of our reach.</i>

1730
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:42,679
<i>That's not your call.</i>

1731
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:43,789
I didn't make it.

1732
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:46,070
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1733
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,918
<i>So, you let him take it</i>

1734
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:49,598
<i>and the war criminal, Loki,</i>

1735
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:51,358
<i>who should be</i>
<i>answering for his crime.</i>

1736
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:53,948
<i>I think he will be.</i>

1737
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:09,440
<i>I don't think you understand</i>
<i>what you've started,</i>

1738
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:11,915
<i>letting the Avengers</i>
<i>loose on this world.</i>

1739
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:13,395
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

1740
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:17,035
<i>They surely are,</i>
<i>and the whole world knows it.</i>

1741
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:20,028
Every world knows it.

1742
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:22,431
<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>

1743
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:24,232
<i>A statement?</i>

1744
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:28,239
<i>A promise.</i>

1745
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:38,079
<i>Sir, how does it work now?</i>

1746
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:41,071
They've gone their separate ways.

1747
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:43,998
Some, pretty extremely far.

1748
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:46,551
If we get into a situation like this again,

1749
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:48,159
what happens then?

1750
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:49,235
They'll come back.

1751
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:52,318
Are you really sure about that?

1752
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:53,395
I am.

1753
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:56,109
Why?

1754
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:59,236
Because we'll need them to.

1755
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,189
Humans.

1756
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:51,592
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

1757
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:54,590
They stand.

1758
02:09:55,400 --> 02:10:01,589
They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.

1759
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:11,033
To challenge them

1760
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:14,709
is to court death.
