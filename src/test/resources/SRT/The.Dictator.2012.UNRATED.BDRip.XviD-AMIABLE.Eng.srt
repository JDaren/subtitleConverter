1
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,722
<i>Tensions are rising
as the stand-off</i>

2
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:51,819
<i>between the world community and the
rogue North African nation of Wadiya</i>

3
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,091
<i>intensified today</i>

4
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:57,157
<i>as U.N. weapons inspectors were once
again refused access to the country</i>

5
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,501
<i>by Wadiyan leader,
Admiral General Aladeen.</i>

6
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,706
I will take no options
off the table. And I mean what I say,

7
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,879
<i>Tonight we ask...
Who is General Aladeen?</i>

8
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,077
<i>According to
Wadiyan propaganda,</i>

9
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,276
<i>Haffaz Aladeen
was bom in 1973.</i>

10
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,788
<i>He did not know his mother,
who died in childbirth.</i>

11
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:25,085
<i>GeneralAIadeen was born
the only son of the Colonel Aladeen,</i>

12
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,461
<i>himself a savage
and violent dictator.</i>

13
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,292
Next!

14
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,066
<i>Known for his iconic beard,</i>

15
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,642
<i>he is protected
by 30 female guards,</i>

16
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,639
<i>who he maintains
are virgin.</i>

17
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,484
<i>Thrust into power
at age seven,</i>

18
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:56,322
<i>he may just be the most dangerous
man in the entire world.</i>

19
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,324
All right,
let's get right to it,

20
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,327
Do you have
nuclear weapons?

21
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,601
What was the question'?

22
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:09,135
Do you have
nuclear weapons?

23
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,431
Sorry, I can't hear you.

24
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,238
Are you developing
nuclear weapons?

25
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,410
No, I literally
can't hear you.

26
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,012
I'm going to
another question.

27
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,277
Oh, I can hear you now.

28
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,419
<i>Eccentric and with
unlimited oil wealth,</i>

29
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,922
<i>he recently hosted
his own Olympic Games...</i>

30
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,419
<i>On your mark, get set.</i>

31
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,535
<i>...at which he won
fourteen gold medals.</i>

32
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,366
Aladeen! Aladeen!

33
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,708
<i>Often described
as ignorant,</i>

34
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,646
<i>he changed
over 300 Wadiyan words to "Aladeen, "</i>

35
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:54,516
<i>including the words "positive" and
"negative," causing mass confusion.</i>

36
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,850
Do you want
the Aladeen news or the Aladeen news?

37
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,488
The Aladeen news'?

38
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,822
You are HIV-Aladeen,

39
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,208
<i>With pressure mounting,</i>

40
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,840
<i>Aladeen addressed
his nation today.</i>

41
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,346
Aladeen! Aladeen!

42
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,108
People of Wadiya,

43
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,012
I come before you today

44
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:08,724
to tell you that the world shall
kneel before our great nation,

45
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:13,964
We are two months away from
enriching weapons-grade uranium

46
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:21,567
to be used
for peaceful purposes,

47
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:32,874
It will be used
only for medical research

48
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,314
and clean energy.
It will, it will.

49
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,150
And will certainly
never be used

50
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,982
<i>to attack ls...
Oh, boy.</i>

51
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,995
<i>With that speech, today,</i>

52
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,658
<i>the international community
is asking one question:</i>

53
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,502
<i>Does the Mad Dog of Wadiya
have nuclear weapons?</i>

54
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,174
Now, show me
my nuclear weapons!

55
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:08,014
I can't wait!
I can't wait!

56
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,331
This is the Beard
of Doom rocket?

57
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,672
This is my weapon?
I will be a laughingstock!

58
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,637
All my friends
have got nuclear weapons,

59
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,368
Even Ahmadinejad!

60
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,942
And he looks like
a snitch on Miami Vice.

61
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,549
Would it kill him
to wear a tie?

62
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,022
I mean, is every day
in Iran casual Friday'?

63
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,883
Where is the Head of my Nuclear
Program and Procurer of Women?

64
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,059
Where is Nuclear Nadal'?

65
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,730
You had Nadal executed,
Supreme Leader.

66
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,192
Why did I do that?

67
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:01,995
Supreme Leader!

68
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,572
Nadal.

69
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,004
We are just months away
from refining weapons-grade uranium,

70
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,908
and we are set
to test the missile next week.

71
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,480
It is too round on the top
It needs to be pointy.

72
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,750
Round is not scary.
Pointy is scary.

73
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,013
This will put a smile
on the faces of the enemy.

74
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,592
They will think that it is a huge robot
dildo flying toward them.

75
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,056
No, Supreme Leader.

76
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,893
The shape of the missile top
has nothing to do with aerodynamics,

77
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,695
It is about
the payload delivery,

78
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,929
No. It sticks in the ground,
and then kaboom.

79
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,904
Supreme Leader,
I think perhaps

80
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,441
some of your information
about bombs is coming from cartoons,

81
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,874
Nonsense.
They were research films,

82
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,609
And in them,
the victims of the bomb

83
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,773
would get
very sooty faces

84
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,884
and then a see-through
version of themselves

85
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,584
started rising up towards Heaven
while playing a harp.

86
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:55,051
In this film,
just one question,

87
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:59,063
was there a duck who,
when the explosion is happens,

88
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,362
his bill goes
around to the back of his head,

89
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,562
and then in order to talk,
he has to put it back this way'?

90
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:09,269
There was somebody
who suffered a deformity like that,

91
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,602
Okay.

92
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:14,042
I am now 100% sure
that you are watching cartoons,

93
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,312
Have you spoken to
the experts about this?

94
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,316
- Have you consulted Professor Bobeye?
- Who?

95
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,819
Professor Bobeye, the one
with the incredibly strong forearms

96
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,946
that are miss-sized
for his body,

97
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,455
The man you are discussing
is called Popeye.

98
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,491
- Bobeye.
- He is not a professor,

99
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:33,393
Popeye is, as the song
tells us, a sailor man.

100
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,263
Indulge me. For one second,
pretend that I'm an idiot.

101
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,394
Okay. I'm there.

102
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,667
And explain to me
how this bomb

103
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,569
will not land in Israel

104
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,335
and then, literally,
bounce right back and blow up Wadiya.

105
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,304
Supreme Leader,
let me explain to you.

106
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,507
You've lost me,

107
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,917
This is the missile
in Wadiya,

108
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,681
you push the button, "Boop!"

109
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,282
Israel

110
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,956
No! Why?

111
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,263
Nuclear winter,

112
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,696
The reality is

113
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,533
<i>0y vey!</i>

114
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:23,937
Us.

115
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,851
Believe me, sir, if I could make
the device even a little more pointy,

116
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,446
I would,
but I simply cannot.

117
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,517
Okay. You know what?

118
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,327
Let's just agree
to disagree, my friend.

119
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,723
Okay.

120
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,333
What? Why'? No!

121
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,399
- Don'! you remember'?
- Of course I remember!

122
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,676
How dare you question my
memory? I remember everything!

123
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,575
No, I would never do that!
Never! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that,

124
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,314
Don't worry, it's fine.
Well done, my friend.

125
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,742
Thank you.

126
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,549
Wait! Wait!
Where are we going?

127
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,745
Admiral General,
what if we just tell the United Nations

128
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,187
we have no nuclear weapons'?

129
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,657
They will lift
the sanctions,

130
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,990
We'll be free
to sell oil rights to the Jalabiya desert,

131
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,654
Uncle Tamir,

132
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,925
Do you not remember
what my saintly father

133
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,897
made me promise him
on his deathbed'?

134
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,563
It was never
to sell Wadiya's oil,

135
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,597
You remember that
was when he gave me power

136
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,675
instead of you,
the rightful heir.

137
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,400
You've been so cool about it

138
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,777
Now, let's go back
to the palace.

139
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,241
It's the season finale

140
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:34,045
<i>of Real Housewives
of Shachahmahahfalimitahlicchl</i>

141
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,712
Aladeen! Aladeen!

142
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,766
Death to the tyrant!

143
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,742
Looks like we need
to find a new double.

144
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,419
Because this one is

145
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,452
You know, I don't know
if he's going to get better.

146
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,818
Oh, he's not going
to recover, sir. He's dead.

147
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,793
Send his wife some
chocolate covered almond nuts

148
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,800
in a cellophane wrapped box.
Delicious.

149
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,934
We're going to send
your wife some almonds,

150
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,234
Chocolate covered
versions of these,

151
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,346
Maroush, I think I dropped
an almond in his head.

152
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,848
Can you take it out?

153
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,749
What I don'! want to do is
send the body to the family

154
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,517
and then they discover
an almond in his head,

155
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,990
and they say,
"Why is there an almond in his head?"

156
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,253
Take it out,

157
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,521
Clean it!

158
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,627
How am I gonna eat that?

159
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,433
- Don't eat it.
- Oh, Maroush!

160
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,700
Listen, everything
is gonna be just fine.

161
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,603
I don'! want you to
worry about anything.

162
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,868
Yeah, how 'bout looking in my eye
when I'm speaking to you?

163
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,813
It's very rude not to look at somebody in
the eye when they're talking to you.

164
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,880
It's okay. Don't worry.
You're having a rough day.

165
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,225
We shot the wrong man.

166
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,866
<i>I can fix this. I have a new
plan. We need to find a new double.</i>

167
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,904
One that is simple enough to
be manipulated completely.

168
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,910
I think we found
what you are looking for.

169
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,498
You think this man
looks like me?

170
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,266
You have
a very þig barn.

171
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:09,062
You mus! have
many happy goats, hmm?

172
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,503
What the fuck
does that even mean?

173
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:16,076
Uncle Tamir,
this thing is an idiot.

174
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,078
What makes you think
he can do the job'?

175
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,079
May I remind you that his only real job is
to be shot in the head.

176
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,419
Very well. Put him
through the process, okay'?

177
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,216
Clip his nails,
file his teeth,

178
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,091
bleach his skin,
and shorten the penis.

179
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,423
Megan! Megan!

180
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,434
You now have herpes.

181
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,869
Megan, you were
worth every penny,

182
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,701
You were super hot,

183
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,274
ls my jet ready'?

184
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,440
Yes, but do you
want to stay the night?

185
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,279
You know, I really
want to do some cuddling.

186
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,546
No. Your time is up,

187
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,610
I have to be
with the Italian Prime Minister tomorrow,

188
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,322
Okay. Maroush,
give the goodie bag!

189
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:01,748
Thanks,

190
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,259
I trust
everything is in there,

191
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,057
as your manager requested'?

192
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,223
Katy Perry said she got
a diamond Rolex.

193
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,961
That's because she let me
Aladeen in her face.

194
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,960
Okay.

195
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,301
Right. Are you sure you don'! want
to stay for some cuddles?

196
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,397
- No.
- But, please,

197
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,965
I really want
someone to cuddle.

198
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,202
<i>Breaking news now.
Just moments ago,</i>

199
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,470
<i>the U.N. Security
Council voted</i>

200
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,910
<i>to authorize NATO
air strikes against Wadiya,</i>

201
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:33,211
<i>unless Admiral General Aladeen
agrees to address the U.N. in person.</i>

202
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,217
<i>And now the world waits.</i>

203
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,548
<i>What will Aladeen do next?</i>

204
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:01,173
Next. No, no, no. No. Boring,
boring. Come on. Come on.

205
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,613
Beloved Oppressor,
I have just received disturbing news,

206
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,048
<i>Welcome
to the Munich Olympics.</i>

207
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,712
<i>Shalom?</i>

208
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,048
<i>0y vey!</i>

209
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,779
Supreme Leader,

210
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,187
the United Nations
demands that

211
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,558
you address their concerns
about our nuclear program,

212
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,790
or they will vole to
authorize military action,

213
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,792
Summon my generals.

214
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,625
I'll join you after
I finish this level,

215
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,631
<i>Bonus round. Mass grave.</i>

216
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:42,577
Those gangsters at the UN
want me to address them.

217
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:46,621
Fine! I'll address them like they've
never been addressed before.

218
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,087
How much time
have they allotted me?

219
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:49,752
Seven minutes, sir.

220
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,555
I'll talk for 14 hours!

221
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,759
And three of those
will be untranslatable,

222
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,265
Literally, baby noises,

223
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,566
Okay. Let's rehearse this.
Role play, role play.

224
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,665
You, come on.
This'll be fun.

225
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,813
So, Secretary General
your soldiers will weep.

226
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,478
I'm so sorry!
Listen, it was not my fault,

227
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,110
I mean, somebody had
set the safety catch

228
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,018
to "Aladeen"
instead of "Aladeen"

229
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,352
Look, I mean
this whole gun

230
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,522
It's gonna be fine.
You just need to ice it,

231
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,090
You got to ice,

232
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,759
Promise me
you're going to ice?

233
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,124
Okay. Tamir!

234
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,630
Inﬂale my neck pillow

235
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,103
and pack my book
of medium-level Sudoku,

236
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,336
We're going to America!

237
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,500
America!

238
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,067
The birthplace of AIDS.

239
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:17,247
Supreme Leader, I took the liberty
of hiring some extra security,

240
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,838
This is Mr. Clayton.

241
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:22,045
Admiral General,
I am here for your protection 2417.

242
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,211
Okay.

243
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,882
But in the interest of full disclosure, I
have to say I hate A-rabs.

244
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,886
Well, that's fine,
because I'm not an Arab.

245
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,928
Well, you're
all A-rabs to me, the blacks, the Jews,

246
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,762
those blue tree-hugging
queers in A-vatar.

247
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,762
In fact, anyone from outside of
America is technically an A-rab.

248
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,034
Listen, while you're here,

249
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:48,408
I highly recommend a visit
to the Empire State Building

250
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,573
before you or one of your
sand-monkey cousins takes it down.

251
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,708
Also, if you're interested in taking
in a Broadway show while you're here,

252
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,512
and you don't mind
the homo stuff,

253
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,848
<i>I highly recommend
Billy Elliot.</i>

254
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,416
You knew what, I like this guy
despite his liberal views.

255
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:04,722
Very good, sir,

256
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:13,601
Supreme Leader, the suite has been
renovated to your specifications,

257
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,272
Twenty dollars a day
for Internet? What the fuck?

258
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:27,312
And they accuse me
of being an international criminal?

259
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,583
Beloved Oppressor,
try to get some sleep,

260
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,281
Tomorrow is
your þig speech

261
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,391
Nobody touch the minibar!
It's a fucking rip-off!

262
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,942
Rise and shine.

263
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,171
Who are you'?

264
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,846
We've actually
already met.

265
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,511
Hello, Aladdin.

266
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,785
Clayton? I thought
we were friends.

267
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,356
Nice to see you, too

268
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,021
Here's the deal,

269
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,357
I'm gonna kill you,
and then I'm gonna bum your body,

270
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,589
No, no, no.
Please, don't.

271
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,830
But before I do I have
one very important question for you.

272
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,594
<i>Did you gel a chance
to see Billy Elliot?</i>

273
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,163
Yes,

274
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,366
And?

275
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:28,204
I found it heartwarming
and life-affirming.

276
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,047
Thank you!
How great is that show'?

277
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,649
It is.
It's great, yeah.

278
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,209
You know, he's got like
an artist inside himself,

279
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:40,049
but he's in this working class place
and no one understands him.

280
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:43,150
He's just like...
I'm gonna express myself in my dance

281
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,658
And he expresses himself.

282
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,797
And he doesn't wanna use violence,
but he puts his violence into his dance,

283
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,159
You should try that,

284
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:54,666
Okay. So, we gotta get down
to business. Enough chit-chat,

285
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,229
I'm being paid to kill you.

286
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,041
But I'm gonna
torture you for free,

287
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,176
Are you serious?

288
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,575
Where'd you get
those relics?

289
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,242
From the Shah of Iran's
garage sale?

290
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:09,675
Yeah, right,

291
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,187
I mean, I know there's
nothing more annoying

292
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,745
than a backseat torturer,
but, please, come on.

293
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,422
This is great stuff,

294
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,926
It's not great stuff.
That's like 1972, hello.

295
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:23,189
You won'! be talking
so much smack with this up your butt.

296
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,862
That's the Anal Umbrella.
It's a good device, I grant you,

297
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,872
but where's
the splash guard?

298
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,908
You're going to kill me
and your white shirt.

299
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,937
It didn't come
with a splash guard.

300
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,034
You're gonna get chara
on your trousers,

301
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,210
I can see it has
a screw hole for one,

302
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,714
<i>Apparently,
það didn't get it.</i>

303
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,081
All right, Mr. Smart Guy,

304
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,378
check out this bad boy,

305
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,922
Oh, that's not bad.
The Kandahar Cock Wrench.

306
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,388
<i>Okay, so, now
we're getting somewhere,</i>

307
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,290
It's actually been banned in Saudi
Arabia for being too safe.

308
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,795
You know,
this is totally depressing.

309
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,463
Listen, just show me
another one,

310
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,296
You know, honestly, I don't even want
to show you anything anymore.

311
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,298
Don't be like that,

312
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,806
You know, I don't even think
you want to be tenured.

313
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,238
I don'! want
to be tortured,

314
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,570
You're just, like,
taking all the fun out of it!

315
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,804
You just want me to say
compliments all the time.

316
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,811
<i>So either you want the truth
or you want compliments, Decide!</i>

317
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,415
It'd be nice if I gotjust a little bit
of positive feedback about my tools.

318
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,383
What else you got'?
I'm gonna love the next thing!

319
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,580
I will be supportive,

320
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,153
All right,

321
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:22,056
Just this. This pours
hot fire out on you.

322
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,227
Oh,
the Fallujah Firehose!

323
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,058
Someone's got
a friend in Syria!

324
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,597
I am pretty proud of it,

325
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,257
There is a new model,
you know.

326
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,799
I've got one that
works by Bluetooth,

327
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,432
<i>Screw it. Screw it!
Screw it!</i>

328
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,069
I'm going to enjoy this now.

329
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,904
No, don't. Don't.
Don't. Please, don't!

330
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:50,319
No one will recognize
the body without this!

331
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,817
The Supreme Beard!
You will be cursed!

332
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,015
No, no, don't do it!

333
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:55,922
Come on!
Why won't this catch'?

334
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,827
You foolish man! There is no earthly
fire that could ever light...

335
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,131
The flames
of the righteous attack the unjust!

336
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,878
<i>I'll be back with help!
J-K.! Just kidding!</i>

337
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,714
MY Speech.

338
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,551
Yo!
Average American shopper!

339
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,718
I do not have
any money on me,

340
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,189
but if you give me
your clothes

341
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,390
I'll make a sizeable donation
in your name to al-Qaeda.

342
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,970
Hey, hey, oh, oh!
Aladeen has got to go!

343
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,303
Hello. lam
Admiral General Aladeen.

344
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,577
I am here to
deliver my speech to the United Nations.

345
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,515
Look, Admiral,
it's too hot for crazy.

346
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:56,811
How dare you'?

347
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,013
Listen, Tamir is
coming right now.

348
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,418
You're going to
be in þig trouble. Here he is,

349
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,224
Tamir! Tamir!

350
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,363
Tamir, it was you, you snake!

351
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,903
He's not the
legitimate leader!

352
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,842
He's not
the legitimate leader!

353
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:25,178
He's not the
legitimate leader!

354
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,516
You have rehearsed the
speech I prepared for you?

355
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,579
Yes. But when is
the General coming?

356
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,017
He's feeling ill,

357
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,351
Does he have worms in his shiishuf?

358
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,587
Very possibly.

359
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,686
Admiral General Aladeen
preparing

360
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,858
<i>to address the General
Assembly of the United Nations.</i>

361
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:43,923
<i>An historic moment.</i>

362
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,696
<i>He's approaching the podium.</i>

363
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,266
<i>And he's walked
right past the podium.</i>

364
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,428
What is he doing?

365
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,864
You are making
a fool out of me!

366
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,199
Let's bring in Denise,
our U.N. correspondent,

367
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,472
What do you make of that?

368
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,214
Well, I have to say,
he's got their attention,

369
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,710
<i>Every eye in the mom
is on him right now.</i>

370
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,219
<i>And he's returning
to the podium.</i>

371
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,884
<i>And he's fallen
off the stage.</i>

372
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,618
<i>What do you make
of that, Denise?</i>

373
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,556
You know, he's clearly implying that the
U.N. must fall before him.

374
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,455
<i>Drinking from the
pitcher of water directly,</i>

375
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,091
<i>as opposed to
the glass that I'm sure must be up there.</i>

376
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,227
<i>What do you think
that means?</i>

377
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,328
<i>Again, it's another
attempt to say,</i>

378
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:23,634
<i>"Listen, I'm not going
to play by your rules. "</i>

379
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,402
<i>And he seems to have
a pitcher of urine out.</i>

380
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,139
<i>I believe he just
urinated in the pitcher.</i>

381
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,575
<i>He is now drinking
his urine.</i>

382
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,477
<i>It looks to be
his own urine.</i>

383
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,280
Sorry. You want?

384
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,851
Trying to force it
on the Israeli delegation.

385
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:39,855
<i>That might be
the ambassador.</i>

386
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,954
<i>He is dumping the urine
on the Israeli delegation.</i>

387
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,457
Oh, that's a good one.

388
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,129
Okay, he's returning
to the podium.

389
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:54,036
Much has been made
of the hostility between our countries,

390
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,870
With the help
of the U.M.,

391
00:24:57,129 --> 00:25:00,542
<i>I will draft a new
constitution for Wadiya</i>

392
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:05,872
and sign it in five days,
on Wadiya's Independence Day,

393
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,206
No, no, no.

394
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,214
<i>This new constitution</i>

395
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,113
<i>will end the dictatorship...</i>

396
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,177
No!

397
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,724
...and it will
turn Wadiya into a

398
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:17,558
democracy,

399
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:22,898
No! Democracy? Never!

400
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,998
Never!

401
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:29,230
The Wadiyan people
love being oppressed!

402
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,542
Dictatorship forever!

403
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,374
Come on! Come with me!

404
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,209
Hurry!

405
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,891
Hello, person. Person,

406
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,493
Black person.

407
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,825
The double that
you found is good,

408
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,662
He is almost as dumb
as the real guy.

409
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,392
So, Wadiya will
become a democracy,

410
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,065
China is a democracy,
too.

411
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,770
Once that constitution
is signed,

412
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:09,073
I will be able
to sell Wadiya's oil rights, Gazprom,

413
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,711
you will have control of
Wadiya's southern oil fields.

414
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,579
B.P., you will
control the north,

415
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,083
Exxon, you will have
all offshore rights,

416
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,415
provided you do not
use B.P.'s drilling rigs.

417
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:21,514
And, Mr. Lao of PetroChina, you will
have the lease on our shale reserves,

418
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,560
Some of those reserves are
in densely populated areas.

419
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,260
Then unpopulate them,

420
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,631
After you've paid me
my 30% finders fee, of course.

421
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,432
Gentlemen,

422
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,431
So, you're going
to make billions,

423
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,529
What will you do
with all those dollars?

424
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:41,638
<i>I will buy the house on Lake Como
next to George Clooney's.</i>

425
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,811
I love George Clooney!

426
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,945
He's an old-fashioned
movie star.

427
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,813
He gay?
He suck my dick?

428
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,282
No, those are just rumors.
Are you a homosexual?

429
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,115
No, no, no, it's more
of a power trip with me,

430
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:56,750
Everybody has a price.

431
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,921
Tommy Lee Jones let me roll it in my
fingers for two hundred grand!

432
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,797
Oh, my gosh,
that was so crazy!

433
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,302
I am so honored
to be able to help you.

434
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,566
Finally, somebody
who knows who I am,

435
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,074
Yeah, of course!

436
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,810
You're the Wadiyan dissident who was
standing up to that asshole Aladeen.

437
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,807
It was so brave of you.

438
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,145
- My name is Zoey,
- I don't care.

439
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,344
What's yours'?

440
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,318
My name is AIa...son.

441
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,657
- Allison?
- Right. Allison.

442
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,826
What's your last name?

443
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,097
Burgers,

444
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,933
Nice to meet you
Allison Burgers.

445
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,699
<i>- You know, I...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

446
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:46,138
Allison, could you
please take your hands off my breasts?

447
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,535
Those are breasts?
I thought you were a boy,

448
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,778
- Where are you taking me to'?
- To Brooklyn!

449
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,322
So, yeah,
this is my store!

450
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:07,864
This is the Free
Earth Collective,

451
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,465
We are a vegan, feminist,
non-profit cooperative operating

452
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,799
within an anti-racist,
anti-oppressive framework

453
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,532
for people of
all or no genders,

454
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,968
We are
a pure democracy,

455
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,136
just like Wadiya's
going to be soon!

456
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,173
Get me clothes,
little man.

457
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,209
Oh, you know what, there's some in
the Earthquake Relief box

458
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:26,840
in the lesbian bathroom,
right there.

459
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,145
Right,

460
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,654
So, Allison,
we're the only store in New York,

461
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,917
other than that fascist
superchain Green World,

462
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,014
that sells your nation's
specialty fruit, mafroom,

463
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,552
which I know
you people eat a lot of,

464
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,693
Oh, I hope that didn't come off
like a cultural stereotype.

465
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,232
Because I'm, like,
the furthest thing from a racist.

466
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:46,196
I pretty much haven'!
had a white boyfriend since high school,

467
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,234
Well, the darker races
are less choosy.

468
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,863
Okay, that came off
as kind of offensive.

469
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,440
Thank you.

470
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,712
Anyway, let me give
you the grand tour.

471
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,612
Up on the roof,
we have this amazing organic garden

472
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,441
Boring! Do you sell
any assault rifles?

473
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,548
Oh, wait. I got ii.
Humor. Right?

474
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,280
Hook a feminist
clown workshop once.

475
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,584
Help! Help! I'm trapped
under a glass ceiling!

476
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,587
What the fuck?

477
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,864
Iwasn't the best
student, but...

478
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,399
We've got this wellness center
downstairs in the basement,

479
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,765
where we do water birth.
Have you ever seen a water birth?

480
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:23,400
Not a water birth,
but I've seen a water death.

481
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:25,131
Wow. Was it moving?

482
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,201
There was actually
very little movement,

483
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,303
A little wriggling,
then two bubbles, and then a þig bloop

484
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:31,709
and the wallet floats up,

485
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,580
You seem educated,

486
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,444
Yes.
I went to Amherst,

487
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,786
I love it when
women go to school,

488
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,881
It's like seeing
a monkey on rollerskates.

489
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,118
It means nothing to them,
but it's so adorable for us,

490
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,628
Okay. Well, hey, Allison,

491
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,962
you knew, we'd love to have you work
here if you ever wanted to.

492
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:55,232
All of our employees
are political refugees, just like you!

493
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,462
There's Hannah over here.

494
00:29:56,595 --> 00:30:00,475
She's from El Salvador. She's a really
useful member of our team.

495
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,571
Useful as what?
A coat hanger?

496
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,648
- Come on.
- Allison, that's not funny

497
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,978
Okay. I tell you what,
get back to work, Captain Hook!

498
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,484
-“Captain Hook.“ It's funny.
- No, it's not funny.

499
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,747
Who's that?

500
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:16,982
Oh, this is Joteph.

501
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,494
He's from a Sudanese tribe
that has no concept of money.

502
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,992
His entire village
was ransacked.

503
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,324
Hey, Sub-Saharan!

504
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:28,162
Do you think you could get me 100
child soldiers here by 5:00 p.m,?

505
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,295
No!

506
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,669
Okay. Time out! Time out.

507
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:31,968
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

508
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,937
Shave your under-the-arms!

509
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:37,110
I dread to think what kind of jungle
you have on your malawachl

510
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:38,938
That is very inappropriate.

511
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,948
Don't tell me what
to say and what not to say, little boy

512
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:44,280
You need to put
that finger away,

513
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,720
I won't put my
finger away because

514
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,313
Look, I've got
two fingers now.

515
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:48,449
Okay.

516
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:52,120
If you do not slop using hateful
language, you cannot work here.

517
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,497
All right. I promise.

518
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:55,793
Okay.

519
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,795
I tricked you,
Wolverine,

520
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,800
Justin Bieber's
chubby double!

521
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,874
Hairy Potter!

522
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,480
Good-bye, old friend.

523
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,994
When will the Supreme
Leader be better?

524
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,086
In lime,

525
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:31,598
He's resting in his bedroom
and must never, ever be disturbed.

526
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,525
Time for bed.

527
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:40,870
Being Aladeen has its perks,
does it not?

528
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,706
Dropped your bell.

529
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:03,198
What are you doing?

530
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,461
She tried to milk me!

531
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:05,724
<i>No,</i>

532
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,130
They are trying
to pleasure you.

533
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,069
Allow the girls to use
their many talents.

534
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,740
No!

535
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:24,310
Supreme Leader!
The girls!

536
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:27,317
Girls, show him
your bosoms.

537
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:56,845
Let me in! I have
85 rooms at this hotel!

538
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:59,013
It's me, Admiral
General Aladeen!

539
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,418
I lost my beard!

540
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,117
You don't got a pass,
you don't get in.

541
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,525
But I'm staying here! I paid twenty
dollars for the fucking Internet!

542
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,197
How much do you charge
for assassinations?

543
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,643
Why is this
happening to me?

544
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:35,889
All I ever did was
steal my country's wealth

545
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,386
and execute anybody
who did not agree with me,

546
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,156
and many who did,

547
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,890
Why me?

548
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:47,030
Why is it always
the good guys? Why'?

549
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,238
Nadal?

550
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,615
Welcome to
the Death to Aladeen Restaurant,

551
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:47,091
Wait. You look
very familiar.

552
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,760
Do I know you?

553
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,231
So sorry, Supreme Leader.

554
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,236
Don't worry.
I'm 50% to blame,

555
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,105
No! No! Supreme Leader!

556
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,948
Definitely not.
I must be going,

557
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,140
No, no. Stay, please.

558
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,577
If you hate Aladeen
and you like good food,

559
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,644
this is the place for you.
This way. Here we go.

560
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,664
Enjoy it,

561
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,637
No! No!

562
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,351
For you.

563
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,825
What is your name?

564
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,456
Allison Burgers,

565
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,994
<i>That's a made-up name,
What's your real name?</i>

566
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:01,762
Ladis.

567
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:03,097
Ladis what?

568
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,372
Ladis Washemm.

569
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,613
So your name
is like the sign. "Ladies Washroom"?

570
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,377
That is a made-up name.

571
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,308
What is your real name'?

572
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,511
I am interested.
We are interested.

573
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,787
Emploice,

574
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,456
Emploice what?

575
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:28,197
Emploice...Muswashans.

576
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,291
That is a made-up name.

577
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,697
Okay.

578
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:37,899
What is your real name'?

579
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,871
Max.

580
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,232
Max what'?

581
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:45,209
Imumoocupancyu
One-hundred-and-twenty,

582
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,515
There's a number in the name?

583
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,215
Who are you?
An Aladeen sympathizer?

584
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:56,187
No, no, no!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. No, no, no!

585
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,248
No!

586
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,760
It's Aladeen!
It's Aladeen without the beard!

587
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,892
No! It's not Aladeen!

588
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:03,824
Hasan, lock the door!

589
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,371
Wait, wait, wait, no!
There you are, cousin!

590
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:12,172
This is my cousin.
I see you've all met him.

591
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:15,173
He's very simple
and backwards. I'm sorry.

592
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,371
- Sorry.
- It's okay, sit,

593
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,777
- Okay.
- Sit and eat,

594
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,610
Have a seat, cousin.

595
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,616
Very sorry.
My apologies. Enjoy,

596
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:25,913
What are you doing here?
And what has happened to your beard?

597
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,551
I've been replaced by this body
double who's a total imbecile,

598
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:31,285
How are you alive?

599
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,123
How am I... Wail.
You don't know?

600
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,357
<i>No,</i>

601
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,799
Every single person
you had executed is still alive,

602
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,226
We all live here
in Little Wadiya.

603
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,772
The executioner, he is
a member of the Resistance!

604
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,369
You mean I never
executed anybody'?

605
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,465
<i>No,</i>

606
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,566
Like, honestly, zero people.

607
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:54,406
Nadal, you must help me
get back into power.

608
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,315
What? No.
Why would I do that?

609
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,785
I have a perfectly
good job here. I'm a Mac Genius!

610
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,613
What do you do'?

611
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,959
Mostly, I clean
semen out of laptops.

612
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,221
Congratulations.
Living the American dream,

613
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,429
Okay, fine. I will help you.
On one condition.

614
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:14,765
Name it,

615
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,464
You reinstate me
as Head of Nuclear Research,

616
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,830
so I can finish
building my bomb.

617
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,231
Deal.

618
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,672
One last thing.

619
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,447
You will let me build
a round nuclear weapon.

620
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,010
Never. It must be pointy,

621
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,678
- Wait a minute. This is
- Whoa.

622
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,481
Okay, compromise. Conical.

623
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,320
- Round. Round,
- Teat-shaped.

624
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,655
Okay.

625
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,296
- Okay. Deal.
- Deal.

626
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,464
Ladies and gentlemen
of the press,

627
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:48,766
our Supreme Leader
is indisposed to answer your questions

628
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:52,770
as he is currently
drafting Wadiya's new constitution,

629
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:55,102
which is scheduled
to be signed

630
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,272
at the Lancaster Penthouse
Ballroom in three days.

631
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,009
Thank you.
No further questions

632
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,489
There is no way we're going to
get anywhere near this hotel

633
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,966
without a security pass,
This is ridiculous.

634
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,364
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

635
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,628
Hiding from that
lesbian hobbit,

636
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:25,198
That woman,
you know hen'?

637
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,406
I cannot begin to tell you
what an honor it is

638
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,375
to be able to provide
all of the catering...

639
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,741
Well, of course.

640
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,143
...and the malroom
for this signing.

641
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,876
You just paid
this month's rent!

642
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:36,018
She offered me a job.

643
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,850
Can you imagine that'?
Me? Working?

644
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,389
Listen, hold onto that badge. It's the only
thing that'll get you past security-.

645
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,424
Okay, thanks.

646
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,993
Wait a minute.

647
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:49,196
Wait, her company is catering the
event, She has a security pass!

648
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,560
That is the answer.
This is the plan.

649
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,159
Okay? You will take that
job and you will work for her,

650
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,336
I will gel you
an identical beard and costume,

651
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:58,836
And then on
the day of the event,

652
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:02,003
you enter the Lancaster
as a member of her staff

653
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,068
You will find the double,
switch with him,

654
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,614
then rip up the constitution
in front of the whole world.

655
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,280
Me? Work for that
hairy titted yeti?

656
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,393
Kimberly'?

657
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:30,228
Zoe?

658
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,532
Who cares?

659
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:34,534
I've come here
to apologize

660
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:38,210
about some of the comments
I may have made about

661
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,315
Captain Hook and Blackie.

662
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,274
Great!

663
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,917
And I accept your job offer
as general manager.

664
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,048
Well, you can't be the manager,
because I am the manager.

665
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,483
Well, I can
if I killed you.

666
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,252
I think I'm starting
to get you.

667
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,458
All right, then...
I will get you.

668
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,061
Great!
Let's get you to work!

669
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,127
Yeah?
Hold on one second,

670
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,998
Hey, my man!
Excuse me. Hairnet!

671
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,129
Yeah.

672
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,143
I need a little of the
quinoa salad, please,

673
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,143
and throw a couple of
extra cranny-b's on top, if you could,

674
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:14,146
and I kind of need you
to hurry up, chief. Chop-chop,

675
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:18,276
Next!

676
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,155
Whoa, whoa!
Occupied!

677
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,522
Out. I have lo clean.
Come on, out you go, out you go,

678
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:25,923
- What? You're hurling me!
- Out. Come on.

679
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:29,424
Hey, Allison,
can you take out the garbage? Thanks.

680
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,964
Look! One of the
customers left a tip of

681
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:44,644
some Nair and some female razors,
Does anybody want to use it?

682
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,112
Slop that.

683
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,384
Suck it, loser.

684
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,729
Clean-up on aisle four!

685
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,035
Hey, buddy, I saw that,

686
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,478
That is very disrespectful
to your leader.

687
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:19,739
Whatever, dude,
Who are you,

688
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,317
Osama bin Laden's
best friend?

689
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,010
No, he is not
my best friend!

690
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,882
Though he has been staying
in my guest house

691
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:29,049
ever since they shot
his double last year.

692
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,989
Now the guy won't leave.

693
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,257
I know why this guy's
the most hated man in the world,

694
00:42:34,352 --> 00:42:36,354
You just have to go
to the bathroom after him.

695
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,398
You go to the bathroom
after Osama,

696
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,231
you will realize
the true meaning of terrorism,

697
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:01,717
Here is the plan,

698
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,554
We're going to take
this helicopter tour

699
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,094
and fly over
the Lancaster to spot its weaknesses,

700
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,024
Remember, we're just two
ordinary American tourists

701
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,356
looking at the sights,

702
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:15,868
Don't worry, nobody gonna suspect
anything. it's a great plan, pointy.

703
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:17,796
Don't do anything
to arouse any suspicions,

704
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,739
Don't worry.
I am Wadiya's number one actor,

705
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,472
You don'! win four
Wadiyan Golden Globes for nothing,

706
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:25,912
Yes, you do,
because you gave them to yourself!

707
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,078
<i>My performance in
Aladeen Jones and the Temple of Doom</i>

708
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,210
was outstanding.

709
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,651
I give it thumbs down.

710
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,449
<i>Have you seen
You've Got Mail Bomb?</i>

711
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,425
Yes, I've seen them all!
They're all terrible movies!

712
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:37,892
Listen to me. Okay?

713
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:40,058
You are a terrible actor,

714
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:44,260
I urge you, right now,
keep your performance small and real.

715
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,268
All right, can you
get me a cloak?

716
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,325
Why'?

717
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:49,166
<i>Because I think
my guy would be wearing a cloak.</i>

718
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,470
No, your guy wears an American flag
sweatsuit and a sheriff's badge.

719
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:54,565
I need the sheriffs badge,

720
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,077
For what?

721
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,442
You're sheriff
of American douche-town!

722
00:43:58,169 --> 00:43:59,170
That's rude.

723
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,271
Listen,

724
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:04,252
We're going to walk over
there, act very inconspicuous.

725
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:05,745
- Okay. No problem.
- This has to work.

726
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,516
Don't worry,
Just relax.

727
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:11,285
Are you okay'?

728
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:12,683
MY guy has a limp.

729
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:16,290
I fell off me horse
at the old Bull & Bush Pub

730
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:17,526
because
I am a cockney,

731
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:18,860
Listen! Listen, okay'?

732
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,765
You need to focus up right now
and be prepared

733
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:24,133
<i>to deliver a small,
subtle perfonnance,</i>

734
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:25,640
- Okay, great, okay.
- Okay, good.

735
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,266
<i>Okay. So, when
we go to fly...</i>

736
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,004
Don't do that
with your eyes!

737
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,773
You can't be
a Chinese person on this thing, okay'?

738
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,143
I'm not chink,
I'm Chinese-American!

739
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:33,307
No, but you cannot
hold your eyes!

740
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:34,611
Nobody is going to think
you're Chinese-American

741
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,650
because you hold
your eyes like that!

742
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,185
It's racist,
what you are doing!

743
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:39,812
<i>Do you know it's a fact
that they cannot pronounce their R's?</i>

744
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,049
They pronounce them
as L's.

745
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,022
<i>So instead you know
what "rabbit" is in Chinese?</i>

746
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,218
I don't know
how to speak Chinese,

747
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:46,522
-it's "labbit."
- It's not "labbi\“!

748
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,223
<i>Yes! Who Shot Lager Labbit
was a huge hit in China!</i>

749
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,321
Nobody
It's stu p

750
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:51,458
All right, I don'! care.
This is stupid, okay'?

751
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:54,496
Okay, I'll do Filipino.
I like to work, I like to talk.

752
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:55,833
- Don't.
- I like the shit, I do the kids.

753
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:56,894
Slop that.

754
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,504
Your Filipino
is the same as your Chinese!

755
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,375
Now who's being a Iacist?

756
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,910
- You're being Iacist now,
- I'm not being racist!

757
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,675
Right now we have to
get on this helicopter

758
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,908
and we have to act
like true Americans.

759
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,814
I guess you don'! want me
to play black then.

760
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:13,255
Of course I don't want you
to play black.

761
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,084
Okay. Just throwing it
out there'

762
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,749
Okay. Don't.

763
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,085
Okay, don'! do that.

764
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,094
- I see what you're doing,
- That's how they walk.

765
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,163
I see what you're doing,
it's not cool.

766
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:23,254
It's how they walk,

767
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,073
I love being
an Americans!

768
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,675
America is number one!

769
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,442
Oh, I am from U.S.A.!

770
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,920
My father also
from U.S.A.

771
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:51,391
My great-grandfather fought
in the American Civil Jihad.

772
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,726
I am very proud
to be an American,

773
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,425
I am America's
number one douche,

774
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,769
I've fooled them' Job done,

775
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:06,405
So, how are things back at the Palace?

776
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:10,606
Fine, but guess
who's still living in my guest house?

777
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:12,637
Ooh, Bin Laden?

778
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:15,379
Yes, Osama.

779
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,079
Bin Laden ﬂooding the bathroom
every time he showers...

780
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:22,056
And how hard is it to put a bath mat
down, Bin Laden?

781
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:27,052
Hey, do you remember
my favorite sports car?

782
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,654
You mean your Porsche?

783
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:30,255
Yes... the 911,

784
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,767
911, it's the best!

785
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:37,339
So I was driving my 911 near the
palace one day...

786
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:39,635
and I totally crashed!

787
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:46,009
It's ck, I've already ordered a new one

788
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:49,016
A brand new 9112012,

789
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,354
You know, while you are here, you
should try to see some of the sights-.

790
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:57,585
Such as the Empire State Building...

791
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,527
and Yankee Stadium,

792
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:05,192
And I'd love to see the fireworks
over the Statue of Liberty.

793
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,368
Hey, have your old back problems been
bothering you?

794
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:16,172
<i>Oh, it's been terrible! It got so bad that
I made myself a back brace.</i>

795
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:20,807
- Really?
- Yes, look, I'm still wearing it,

796
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:24,851
Hey. my English is getting good

797
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:28,549
I bet I can count down from five
faster than you can!

798
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,825
<i>Five, four,
three, two, one!</i>

799
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,530
Allison! Are you okay'?

800
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,067
L. Yes,

801
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,797
You know what?
You people, you make me sick!

802
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,340
You see a Middle Easterner
on an aircraft

803
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:48,468
and you just assume
that he's hatching some violent plot?

804
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:53,072
Allison Burgers is a persecuted
dissident, not a murderous madman!

805
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,014
He was reported saying, "Let's take out
the guards at the Lancaster."

806
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,553
Guess what?
We deliver to the Lancaster!

807
00:47:58,642 --> 00:47:59,643
Good one!

808
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,816
Maybe he wanted to
take the guards out for a falafell

809
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,154
That's a bit
of a stereotype,

810
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:07,355
but I get the idea.
Great idea! Yeah. You.

811
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:10,422
You know what?
Is it a crime to care about your job?

812
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:11,693
Yeah! Well,
it is in Wadiya.

813
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:15,270
Where did you get your diversity
and sensitivity training, huh?

814
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,565
The Stasi?

815
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,665
Let's see how you feel about racial
profiling when white people...

816
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,780
And I know
what I'm talking about

817
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:37,416
because I majored
in Fem Lit!

818
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,455
Come on,

819
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:42,794
Hey! What are you doing?
Where are you going?

820
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:43,888
Don't worry!

821
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:46,059
Just suck the fatoot
of the biggest guy, you'll be fine.

822
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,124
You're really
fucking me here, man!

823
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,467
The police here
are such fascists!

824
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:52,700
Yeah, right,
and not in a good way.

825
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,401
It just makes me so mad!

826
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:57,241
You know, Zoey,
you were great back there,

827
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,939
Thanks. I just

828
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,106
I don'! know,
I just feel so sorry

829
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:02,582
that wherever
you go in the world,

830
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,313
you're the victim
of police abuse.

831
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,478
Well, not always the victim,

832
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:09,955
Come here.
I'm just so sorry! You're okay now.

833
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:11,284
All right?

834
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:13,760
And I'm not gonna
let anything bad happen to you.

835
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:15,559
You know what? Let's get you
back to the collective, okay?

836
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,298
Come on,

837
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:18,389
No, a bit more.

838
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,297
Okay.

839
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,960
- Come on, let's go. I need to go to work.
- I feel so sad!

840
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,732
Let's do another hug, okay?

841
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,503
Allison, why are you sad'?

842
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,009
The brutality'?

843
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,110
Did you suffer
from sexual abuse?

844
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:35,309
Yes, they raped me in
a very unprofessional way.

845
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:38,654
Oh, no.
We have to get you to the Rape Center.

846
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,585
You have a center
for rape here?

847
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,920
Great! I'd love to go!
Maybe another time, you know.

848
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,291
Hire a limo, have some
cocktails, bring my raping shoes,

849
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:56,336
Can you get me that one?

850
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:58,529
Which one?

851
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,802
The one with
the "fuck-me hooves,"

852
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,840
You're bizzare. I'm going to have
to change the channels now.

853
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:07,111
<i>Mtour from hell
for an Ohio couple earlier today when,</i>

854
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:08,477
<i>...with shades of 9/11,</i>

855
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:11,611
<i>their helicopter tour
of the Manhattan skyline was cut short</i>

856
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:15,817
<i>by what police are new
calling a "terrorism misunderstanding"</i>

857
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,726

858
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:21,519
Elra.

859
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,392
<i>We have a problem,</i>

860
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,839
Hannah, that guy from the
Lancaster's coming tomorrow morning

861
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:33,705
so why don't you take
the mafroom downstairs

862
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,799
and make some sort of
a nice display?

863
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,471
I just want everything
to be perfect.

864
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,173
Zoey?

865
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:41,409
Allison. Hi.

866
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:44,178
To thank you for what you did
today at the police station,

867
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,517
I have decided to
bestow upon you a gifi

868
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,221
- That's sweet. What is it?
- Yeah'

869
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:59,261
I don't know
what that is.

870
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:02,165
It's fine.
Please, gobble up my little mouse.

871
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:04,201
Snack on my
tiny raisin.

872
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,907
Give her
a mouth bath- Go

873
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:09,912
Oh! No!

874
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:13,438
No, I am not
going to do that,

875
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:16,012
I'm getting a lot of this
and not much of this.--.

876
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,851
Listen, I understand
that you're having urges, okay'?

877
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:22,947
Right,

878
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:25,618
But you need to
take care of them by yourself,

879
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,759
Myself? What? How'?

880
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:29,556
You need to
touch yourself.

881
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,394
I don't touch myself.
Do you touch yourself?

882
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,032
I think most
healthy people do, yes.

883
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,437
Yeah, you touch your own
malawach? Disgusting! Yuck!

884
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:39,599
Yuck!

885
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:43,276
Stop joking, all right?
You've never jerked off'?

886
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,873
Okay, come with me.

887
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,939
Where are you taking me to?
The Rape Center?

888
00:51:52,977 --> 00:51:54,479
This is silly.

889
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:56,155
<i>Qkay...</i>

890
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:59,594
Take your penis out
and put it in your hands,

891
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,720
This is silly.

892
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:06,624
Now, slowly move your hand
up and down.

893
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:07,794
Okay.

894
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,799
I told you already,
this is...

895
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,303
Wail,

896
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:17,575
What sorcery is this?

897
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,673
<i>Some people
wait a lifetime</i>

898
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:25,481

<i>Whoa, I can'! believe

902
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:40,268
<i>Some people

<i>I can'! believe
ilk happening to me</i>

905
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:59,049
I did it!
I justjerked it completely off!

906
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:00,622
<i>Það did it all by myself!</i>

907
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:03,022
With this hand right here!

908
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,322
I grabbed my bilbul
like I was strangling a bird.

909
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,556
And I smacked it
and I smacked it and I gave it a flick,

910
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:09,995
and out came
my own Iabeneh!

911
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,221
Zoey?

912
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:14,995
Zoey! You have
changed my life!

913
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:19,565
Give a man a vagina
and he will shpichs for a day.

914
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:23,367
Teach a man to use
his hand as a vagina,

915
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,410
and he will shpichs
for a lifetime.

916
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,008
Oh. No, no. Thank you.

917
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,417
Allison, you may need to keep
your voice down because.-.

918
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:34,478
We've got a lot of customers.
You may want to go wash up,

919
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:35,580
Fine,

920
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,353
Joteph, go and hose dawn
my Crocs.

921
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:41,855
I've done my Iabeneh
all over the wellness center,

922
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,531
Okay.

923
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,900
The guy from the Lancaster
is going to love this.

924
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:54,732
Okay.

925
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,271
Good night, Allison.

926
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,171
I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

927
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,905
Good night! Thank you again.

928
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,620
This is nice. Or lovely.

929
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,295
- Who is it?
- Nada}.

930
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:15,419
<i>What are you doing?</i>

931
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:17,123
I've discovered
this amazing thing.

932
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,063
I have to show you
how to do it.

933
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:20,962
It's called self juicing,

934
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:24,062
You put your hand
on your bilbul and you rub it,

935
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:26,404
<i>and then you can make
your own labeneh come out.</i>

936
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,874
<i>You don'! have to
spend any Rolexes.</i>

937
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:29,774
<i>You don't have to give
any dirty diamonds.</i>

938
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,711
<i>I cannot believe I'm having this
conversation with an adult man.</i>

939
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,374
What do you mean?
You knew about this?

940
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:35,814
<i>Everybody knows about this.</i>

941
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:39,818
<i>We all know about this
from the age of 12, 13.</i>

942
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:41,979
Why does nobody
ever tell me anything?

943
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:44,956
<i>Because you have everybody executed
who tells you anything.</i>

944
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:47,661
Listen, I'm thinking of
revealing my true identity

945
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:49,660
to the hairy titted ape woman,

946
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,960
Whoa! No, what?
Why would you even do that?

947
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,591
I think she'll be
cool with it.

948
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:55,303
<i>She will not be cool with it.</i>

949
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:58,463
<i>How is she to judge?
She shaves her armpits once a year,</i>

950
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:01,168
and she takes lovers
outside of her ethnic group.

951
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,275
Are my crimes any worse
than hers?

952
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,502
<i>Remember, you hate her.</i>

953
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,248
And everything
she stands for.

954
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,618
- Okay.
- I have to go now.

955
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:11,942
I despise you.

956
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,179
You know, sometimes you say
some very hurtful things.

957
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:15,846
Anyway, I'm going to
hang up on you.

958
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,858
No, come on. This is
like a real opportunity for me

959
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,019
I want to hang up first.

960
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:21,824
I've hung up.
I hung up already,

961
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,796
That is your voice
doing that noise. You have not hung up,

962
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:27,529
<i>lam hanging up. Click...</i>

963
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:29,965
Nadal, are you still there?

964
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,702
- Nadal, are you still there?
- I win.

965
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:36,168
No wonder you're a Mac Genius.

966
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,513
<i>What a fucking idiot.</i>

967
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,618
Zoey!

968
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:53,325
Zoey!

969
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,892
Zoe?

970
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:13,971
Elra.

971
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:16,740
<i>Etra,..</i>

972
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,779
Etra, is this because
you're the only virgin guard

973
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:47,041
that I left a virgin?

974
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,830
One, two...

975
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:22,001
Bloop.

976
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,772
Text book.

977
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:29,314
Thank you so much
for meeting me early, Mr. Ogden.

978
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,380
I cannot wait for you
to sample our mafroom.

979
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,350
You are gonna swear
that you're in Wadiya.

980
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,290
Excuse me.
What is that over there?

981
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,526
That is a "C"
in your window.

982
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,854
<i>No, no, no... They're totally
biased against this. They hate us.</i>

983
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:42,692
No, it's not.
I know what a "C" means.

984
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:43,992
It's not a very good

985
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:49,564
Oh. my God!

986
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,206
Allison, what happened'?

987
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,502
I don't know, I...

988
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,246
I was downstairs
self juicing.

989
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,039
All night?

990
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:03,340
Yes,

991
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:04,815
I'm sorry,
you were doing what?

992
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:06,414
Doing the jerk ofi.

993
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,551
Jerking myself to totally off.

994
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,181
- I'm sorry?
- Let me show you.

995
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,586
- No.
- She taught me,

996
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:12,852
Oh, she taught you, did she?

997
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:15,362
- No...
- Well, thank you very much,

998
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:16,691
The contract is canceled

999
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:17,754
- That's it!
- No.

1000
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,265
No, I'm going to Green World.
It's over.

1001
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,868
- No, Mr. Ogden.
- Remember, I have to pay that

1002
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:23,905
- Please, no, no.
- Self juicing. Filth!

1003
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:26,032
<i>Oh, my God...</i>

1004
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:27,534
Zoe?'

1005
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,334
We must gel
that contract back,

1006
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,771
We can't!

1007
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:33,914
It's impossible.
We can't compete with Green World,

1008
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:36,447
We will see about that,

1009
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,680
But from now on,
it is my way

1010
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:44,419
<i>or the highwahahlmaa-
fferrohshelechnichway.</i>

1011
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,460
There has been
a regime change!

1012
00:59:47,551 --> 00:59:49,895
Yo! You are
stocking the shelves.

1013
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:52,733
You, senile
Romanian accountant.

1014
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,462
You are on
the cash register,

1015
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:58,572
<i>The CEO of Green Wand
does not drive a hybrid!</i>

1016
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,970
<i>The chemicals
in Green World produce</i>

1017
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:05,406
<i>made this boy
grow tits!</i>

1018
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,247
You promise not
to steal again?

1019
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,983
I won't. I won't!

1020
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:16,952
Give him one more
for fun, Viktor.

1021
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,412
Good choice,

1022
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:54,789
Hi, Viktor.

1023
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,370
Supreme Grocer.

1024
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:14,210
The radicchio
has been washed and sorted,

1025
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:16,045
and the spray hose
has been tightly coiled,

1026
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,812
Very good. Now go upstairs

1027
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:20,150
and finish composting
the wheatgrass tailings, okay'?

1028
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,484
Yes, Supreme Grocer.

1029
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,823
Zoey!

1030
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,157
What? Look

1031
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:28,819
Wow!

1032
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:30,897
It's amazing!

1033
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:33,729
Oh, it's not amazing.
It's just a little less shit.

1034
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,833
Well, thank you.

1035
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,802
- Sorry.
- Oh, of course.

1036
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,741
- Personal.
- Thank you. Thank you again,

1037
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,846
- Hello?
- I have some very good news.

1038
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:46,972
<i>What is if?</i>

1039
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:50,678
I managed to buy some beards at the
wig store today that are perfect

1040
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,981
<i>No, Nadal,
it must be real hair.</i>

1041
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,080
<i>- And from the head of a great man!
- What?</i>

1042
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:56,851
<i>Like Castro or Gandalfi</i>

1043
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,187
No...

1044
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,691
Well done, Nadal.
This beard is perfect.

1045
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:10,929
Those are lovely ﬂowers.

1046
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:12,938
You know, Zoey is
thinking of opening

1047
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,373
an eco-friendly
flower section to the store,

1048
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:18,743
This is the fifth time you've mentioned
her today, What is going on?

1049
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:20,508
The signing
is in two days,

1050
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,413
Tell me you're not
falling for this woman!

1051
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:25,546
Of course I'm not.
This is silly.

1052
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,879
Okay, good- All we need to do
is slip into this chapel...

1053
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,117
And yet, it's strange.

1054
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,124
The other day,
I asked her to, you know,

1055
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,889
gobble on my bilbul
and she said, "No."

1056
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,953
So obviously
I wanted to execute her,

1057
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:40,296
But the thought of
her decapitated head actually upset me,

1058
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:42,131
-so I decided not to do it,
- No.

1059
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:45,570
When the thought of someone's
decapitated head upsets you,

1060
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:47,404
that is love.

1061
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:50,635
- I swear, I don't even like her at all,
- You don't like hen'?

1062
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,576
She has the body shape
of a 14-year-old boy.

1063
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:57,646
Well, that is
a particular weakness of yours,

1064
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:59,652
Need I remind you of
the Menudo incident?

1065
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:01,617
Those boys had
their eyes open.

1066
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:02,985
They knew exactly
what they were doing,

1067
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,581
We made them
have their eyes open,

1068
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:06,821
You made me hold
one of their eyes open,

1069
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,554
so they'd see what
you were doing to them,

1070
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,156
They seemed to be having
a pretty good time-.

1071
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,734
They were not.
Those boys were crying,

1072
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,264
Three of them
killed themselves!

1073
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:17,397
Nothing to do with me,

1074
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,838
Everything to do with you!
A lot of them wrote notes.

1075
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:22,603
In their suicide notes
they named you by name!

1076
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,142
It's all a rumor.
And you're being silly.

1077
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:27,078
Hello, gentlemen,
How you doin“?

1078
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:28,839
Are you guys
friends of the deceased?

1079
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:30,949
How do I put this'?

1080
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:32,676
He was my nigger,

1081
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:34,488
No, that's not
the way to put it,

1082
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:36,249
- Whoa, whoa!
- No?

1083
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,787
He was my negger
Nigger. Nagger?

1084
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,187
- No, no, no.
- What is that?

1085
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:40,590
- Negar. Nigger? Nagun'?
- No, no.

1086
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,822
Please stop. Please.

1087
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:42,953
I told you,
before we came in.

1088
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:45,522
One word, do not say.
ls the exact word you're using now.

1089
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:46,999
- No, I said Nuga...
- One dozen times,

1090
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,137
Please relate to him that there could be
two funerals today.

1091
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,206
I... Believe me
when I tell you,

1092
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,640
we are here only
to pay our respects to a great man.

1093
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:58,038
Okay, Eldridge's casket
is laying in the chapel right now.

1094
01:03:58,335 --> 01:03:59,871
We're gonna have the
viewing in a few minutes,

1095
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,375
Thank you very much,

1096
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,383
I love your music,
by the way.

1097
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:05,952
No, it's not.
He's not a musician.

1098
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:09,956
I'm so, so sorry that
Whitney tumed out like she did,

1099
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,320
- It's not Bobby Brown
- Hey...

1100
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:18,226
- Go there.
- Okay, Here we go.

1101
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:28,968
Hello?
Somebody in here?

1102
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,171
Nada]!
The Sub-Saharans have discovered us!

1103
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:32,838
- What'? Okay, okay, okay!
- Hurry, hurry!

1104
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:34,404
- Just a moment!
- What you doin' in there?

1105
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,542
Jerking off.

1106
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,141
Open this door!

1107
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,521
- No, no, no!
- Open the door now!

1108
01:04:40,744 --> 01:04:43,088
Quick! Plan B! Plan B!

1109
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:53,759
Why did you
chop off his head?

1110
01:04:53,857 --> 01:04:54,927
You said Plan B!

1111
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,833
Plan B was to have
coffee and regroup,

1112
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,237
it was not to
chop his head off!

1113
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,079
Good morning, Nadall

1114
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:12,283
Wake up!
Good morning, Nadal!

1115
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:16,414
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1116
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,614
Get this away from me!

1117
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:18,954
You know, me and you
are quite a team.

1118
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:20,049
No, no.

1119
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:21,561
You know who else
makes a great team?

1120
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:24,098
<i>Ebony and ivory</i>

1121
01:05:24,187 --> 01:05:25,598
No, no, no!

1122

<i>Live together
in perfect harmony</i>

1123
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:28,124
What is wrong with you'?
Get it out of here!

1124
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:30,193
<i>Good one,</i>

1125
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:36,611
<i>Splish splash
I was taking a bath!</i>

1126
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:39,137
No! Get it out of here!

1127
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:41,976
Oh, that is weird.

1128
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:48,320
I threw in some carob-covered goji
berries, just as a treat. Enjoy.

1129
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:53,090
Thank you. That's very kind of
you. You're a very nice man,

1130
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,652
What the fuck
did you call me?

1131
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:58,496
I said you were nice!

1132
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:07,441
Allison! The Lancasterjust
called! We got the contract back!

1133
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:09,602
- Great! Whatever!
- I know!

1134
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:12,010
Green World is shutting down
their Manhattan store!

1135
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,246
I wonder what
could have happened?

1136
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,277
Be careful with that,
sweetheart. Be careful.

1137
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:21,350
Oh, yeah, we're going to
have a nice þig salad.

1138
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:23,919
Celebratory cuddle?

1139
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:26,619
Well done!

1140
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:28,194
- You smell bad.
- I know.

1141
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:29,789
Help!

1142
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:32,094
Somebody help!
My wife is in labor!

1143
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:34,026
Oh, my God!
Oh. my God!

1144
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,000
Baby? The ambulance can't
be here for 20 minutes. Can you hold it?

1145
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,766
I can't hold it!
It's coming out!

1146
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:40,166
It's coming out!

1147
01:06:40,263 --> 01:06:42,971
Does anyone have
any medical experience?

1148
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:46,806
I was Wadiya's Chief Surgeon
for the last 22 years.

1149
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:48,878
Please.
Please help us. Please.

1150
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:51,140
- Allison, they need your help. Come on.
- Okay, fine.

1151
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:52,775
Come on,

1152
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:54,346
Are you okay'?

1153
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:57,485
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

1154
01:06:57,547 --> 01:06:58,958
Sorry! Old habits die hard.

1155
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,055
All right, I'm going in.

1156
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:04,021
That's the wrong hole!

1157
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,066
- What?
- You just put your fist up the wrong hole,

1158
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:07,860
If I had a dollar for
every time I heard that,

1159
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:10,796
Get it outta there,

1160
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,496
- Going in again.
- Okay, good.

1161
01:07:13,663 --> 01:07:15,233
Still my asshole!

1162
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:17,000
What is wrong
with you, man?

1163
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,545
You just put it in
my asshole again!

1164
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:20,137
Just go up
from where you are,

1165
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:23,477
The good news is,
your prostate is completely healthy.

1166
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:26,080
That's good. That's good,

1167
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:27,719
- Going in again.
- Okay, good.

1168
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:32,586
Hold on.

1169
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:34,987
What are you.

1170
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,863
Allison, stop it!
You need two hands!

1171
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:40,360
But I'm in the middle
of the text.

1172
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,194
It's coming out!

1173
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:48,841
- Where is that coming from?
- What?

1174
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,105
I'm really sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this call,

1175
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:57,682
ls there a phone
in my body?

1176
01:07:57,941 --> 01:07:59,284
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1177
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:00,786
I'm in
the Lincoln Tunnel,

1178
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,354
<i>What? Okay, look.
We need to talk for a minute.</i>

1179
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,626
Hello, Nadal.
Listen, I can't speak now.

1180
01:08:05,715 --> 01:08:07,217
I'll speak to you later,
okay? Bye!

1181
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,461
Stop talking to my vagina!

1182
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:13,461
Zoey, the baby's stuck. I need you to put
your hand in and help me,

1183
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,030
- What? No...
- Come on! Put it in!

1184
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,798
- No, don't be scared. Put it in.
- Okay. Okay.

1185
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,403
- I'm sorry.
- Put it right there on the right side,

1186
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,407
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!
- Push in.

1187
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:22,702
I think I feel an arm!

1188
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,301
That's my finger.

1189
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:41,252
Excuse me. You guys
make a really cute couple together,

1190
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:42,955
But maybe could you finish doing this

1191
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:44,998
when you're not elbow-deep
in my pussy!

1192
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:47,562
Okay, Allison,
you've got the head?

1193
01:08:47,824 --> 01:08:49,599
- I've got the head.
- Okay, it's coming out,

1194
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:50,729
Come on, push!

1195
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:56,006
Where are the rebel bases?
Where are the rebel bases?

1196
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:57,902
Sorry, sorry.

1197
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:01,148
Wait, I can see the head!
I can see the head!

1198
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:02,341
I can't push anymore!

1199
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:09,289
You did it!
You did it!

1200
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,863
I sentence you

1201
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:20,690
to life,

1202
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,296
It's still attached!

1203
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:26,373
Sorry. Oh, no.

1204
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:27,872
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

1205
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,599
It's bad news,

1206
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:31,036
It's a girl,

1207
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,204
Where's the trash can'?

1208
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:36,439
No, no, no, no!
That's what we wanted!

1209
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:38,379
We'll take her,
we'll take her.

1210
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:39,475
Oh, baby.

1211
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:46,824
You were so
amazing down there.

1212
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,221
You saved
a little person's life,

1213
01:09:58,394 --> 01:09:59,998
It feels so nice
to kiss you.

1214
01:10:00,063 --> 01:10:01,508
I know. It's nice
to kiss you, too,

1215
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:03,066
I love the hugging.

1216
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:04,910
I just came,

1217
01:10:08,171 --> 01:10:09,673
I don't care.

1218
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,178
Lie back,

1219
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:13,311
Okay.

1220
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,049
This is going to be
amazing for you.

1221
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:16,487
Okay!

1222
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,071
You have such
a small stomach,

1223
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,537
It's like
a 10-year-old boy's

1224
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:38,071
Normally, I don't kiss
a 10-year-old boys stomach,

1225
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:39,507
They kiss mine.

1226
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:41,871
See you in 15 minutes.

1227
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:46,344
Okay.

1228
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:56,727
Wait, wait.

1229
01:10:57,053 --> 01:10:58,396
Wail,

1230
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:02,529
Allison,
before we go any further,

1231
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,463
there's something
that I want to tell you.

1232
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:08,299
You've got a dick.
I knew it.

1233
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:11,204
<i>Allison,
I don't have a dick.</i>

1234
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:12,708
Great!

1235
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:15,447
And I've never been
with a guy with a dick.

1236
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:16,946
Or any guy

1237
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:19,643
Or boys.

1238
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:22,983
Just girls,

1239
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,450
And children,

1240
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,792
Not male ones.
Female ones.

1241
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:34,731
What I wanted to
tell you was this.

1242
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,965
I really wan!
to be with you, Allison Burgers,

1243
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,069
Zoe?

1244
01:11:41,831 --> 01:11:43,936
I'm not really
Allison Burgers,

1245
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:47,675
I'm actually
a little somebody called

1246
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:50,673
Admiral General

1247
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:52,647
Aladeen.

1248
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,252
No, what's your real name?

1249
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,189
Wait, this will
convince you.

1250
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:04,089
Look, it's me!

1251
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:08,161
The weapons inspectors
will bathe in their own blood!

1252
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:11,037
That's your beard'?

1253
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:13,164
No, no, no!
It's not my beard.

1254
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,299
My friend chopped the head
oh' Morgan Freeman.

1255
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:18,041
It's a hilarious story.
I'll tell you later, okay'?

1256
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:21,878
You are out of your mind.
You're insane!

1257
01:12:22,038 --> 01:12:24,985
Well, you download songs
illegally from the Internet.

1258
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,044
<i>So let's not
throw stones, okay'?</i>

1259
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,153
You're a murderer!

1260
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:31,515
No, no, no!
Zoey, Zoey, Zoey! No,

1261
01:12:31,614 --> 01:12:34,857
You were just using me
to get access to that hotel!

1262
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:36,157
No!

1263
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:39,826
Zoey, I'm attracted to you
in a really fucked-up way.

1264
01:12:40,323 --> 01:12:42,325
Oh. my God!

1265
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:45,195
I'm canceling that
contract tomorrow!

1266
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,902
No, Zoey! What have
I ever done wrong?

1267
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:50,166
You lied to me!

1268
01:12:50,233 --> 01:12:52,679
And you're wanted
for war crimes!

1269
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,339
That stuff never sticks.

1270
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:56,645
You need to leave now.

1271
01:12:57,673 --> 01:13:01,143
You have broken my heart
into Aladeen pieces.

1272
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:26,111
<i>With the signing of the
constitution tomorrow morning,</i>

1273
01:13:26,202 --> 01:13:28,705
<i>democracy in Wadiya
is just hours away,</i>

1274
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:31,115
<i>and people are
in the streets celebrating.</i>

1275
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,886
<i>Kill Aladeen,
killAIadeen, hey!</i>

1276
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:35,452
<i>Kill Aladeen,
killAIadeen, hey!</i>

1277
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:41,625
<i>What do you think of
Admiral General Aladeen?</i>

1278
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,697
<i>We hale him. We hate him.</i>

1279
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:46,289
<i>You know,
when we think of him, we...</i>

1280
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:48,966
<i>We vomit, and we spit
and we don'! want him.</i>

1281
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:51,296
<i>What would you say to General
Aladeen if he were watching this?</i>

1282
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:53,200
<i>I have a message
forAIadeen.</i>

1283
01:13:53,696 --> 01:13:54,902
<i>Suevel.</i>

1284
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,256
- Good-bye!
- Stop, stop, wait!

1285
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:19,322
What are you doing?

1286
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:21,657
How did you find me'?

1287
01:14:22,258 --> 01:14:24,329
You texted me, like,
seven times,

1288
01:14:26,262 --> 01:14:27,935
I am executing myself!

1289
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:29,607
What? why'?

1290
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:31,301
Because no one
has ever loved me!

1291
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:33,738
Your father would
be ashamed of you!

1292
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,443
No, I've realized
I don't want to be like my father!

1293
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:39,076
In fact,
I don't want to be a dictator anymore!

1294
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,313
What's that now?

1295
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:43,319
<i>I've been on a spiritual journey,
man, like Eat, Pray, Love.</i>

1296
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,253
Have you gone insane?

1297
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,519
I now know that
on the outside,

1298
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:49,994
<i>I am a bit of
a cocksucker</i>

1299
01:14:50,286 --> 01:14:53,165
- Yeah.
- But deep down I'm nice.

1300
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:55,766
- Not really.
- Yes, I am! I'm like mafroom.

1301
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:58,164
Hard and spiky
on the outside,

1302
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,331
but soft and
really mushy on the in.

1303
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:03,874
<i>You're not like
mafroom at all. You're like an onion,</i>

1304
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,146
An outer layer
of cocksucker,

1305
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:07,647
and when you
peel it away,

1306
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:10,445
there is 10 more layers
of cocksucker underneath,

1307
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:13,884
You are such a schmuck!

1308
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,713
- Why are you speaking Yiddish?
- I picked it up,

1309
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,326
What do you mean,
"I picked it up"? Who picks up Yiddish?

1310
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:20,554
I'm in New York!

1311
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,890
We're trying to erase
that country off the map!

1312
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:25,056
I don'! like the people,
but I like the way that

1313
01:15:25,154 --> 01:15:27,828
their words really sound like
what they're meant to be.

1314
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,734
Oh, I'm sorry! Did I not get the
Evite to your bar mitzvah?

1315
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:31,998
Oh. my God!

1316
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:34,132
You've got real
chutzpah saying that!

1317
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,403
Look, where has being
a nice guy gotten you, huh?

1318
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,906
<i>Standing on the edge
of a bridge about to commit suicide?</i>

1319
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,071
Still wearing Crocs?

1320
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:42,181
What's wrong with Crocs?

1321
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:45,242
They are the universal symbol of a
man who has given up hope!

1322
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,355
You might as well
put sweatpants on

1323
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:50,357
and go to Applebee's
for the rest of your life!

1324
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,360
I'll give you that one,
I do look ridiculous.

1325
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:57,262
Yes! Listen, if you won't
come down from there for yourself,

1326
01:15:57,353 --> 01:15:58,593
do it for your country,

1327
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,529
If this constitution
is signed,

1328
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:03,832
there will be free press,
women drivers, civil rights!

1329
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:05,096
What are "civil rights"?

1330
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,670
I'll tell you later.
They're hilarious.

1331
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:11,611
Look, you alone can stop
these terrible things from happening,

1332
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,507
You are the last
great dictator!

1333
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:17,077
All of the others
are gone! Qaddafi,

1334
01:16:17,273 --> 01:16:19,776
Saddam, Kim Jong, Cheney.

1335
01:16:21,844 --> 01:16:23,289
You are right, Nadal.

1336
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,851
I will become
the greatest dictator of all,

1337
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,917
the envy of madmen
everywhere!

1338
01:16:28,117 --> 01:16:29,721
Yes, Supreme Leader!

1339
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:33,198
From the mountaintops of North Korea
to the jungles of Zimbabwe,

1340
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:37,533
let every child laborer
and sweatshop factory worker sing,

1341
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,267
"Oppressed at last!
Oppressed at last!

1342
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:43,439
"Thank Aladeen,
I am oppressed at last!"

1343
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:44,704
Yes! Whoa!

1344
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,075
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1345
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:47,546
- No, no, no, no, don'! fall.
- I'm not doing anything.

1346
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,277
Just do like a pull-up.
You know how you do pull-ups?

1347
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:51,578
I invented the pull-up.

1348
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:58,950
<i>If you're just joining us, we
are at the Lancaster Hotel,</i>

1349
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:00,755
<i>where in about 20 minutes,</i>

1350
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:04,661
<i>General Aladeen will be signing the
new Wadiyan constitution.</i>

1351
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:06,596
<i>Dignitaries from
around the world</i>

1352
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:09,602
<i>are arriving now to witness
the creation of a democracy</i>

1353
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:12,468
<i>that will undoubtedly change
the political landscape</i>

1354
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,268
<i>of the entire region.</i>

1355
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:17,501
<i>As Wadiya goes,
so goes North Africa.</i>

1356
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:26,816
Eddie Norton, next time
you pee on me.

1357
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,179
Whatever,

1358
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:30,513
And tell Viggo Monensen
he is on my radar.

1359
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,360
How do you say,
"Fly is in the soup"?

1360
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:37,294
Gentlemen, Tamir.

1361
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,792
Let me introduce you
to my beautiful wife.

1362
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,768
Mrs. Lao, it is my
very great pleasure,

1363
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,998
No, no, no, no.
She does not speak English,

1364
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:46,300
Watch this.

1365
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,634
You ugly horse!

1366
01:17:49,298 --> 01:17:50,333
She doesn't know,

1367
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:55,142
"Ohhh." See?
She goes "Ohhh" all the time. Watch,

1368
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,344
Shaved ape.

1369
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:58,975
"Ohhh."

1370
01:18:12,488 --> 01:18:15,492
Wait. That is how you intend to get me
across to the Lancaster?

1371
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:16,828
Absolutely,

1372
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:18,235
- Where'd you get that?
- I built it

1373
01:18:18,661 --> 01:18:20,902
When I was going
to assassinate you.

1374
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:22,400
You mean my double.

1375
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:26,478
Sure, Yeah,

1376
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,156
Bingo; Love it!

1377
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:41,319
- Here's what you do.
- Okay.

1378
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,387
Zipline across,
kill the double,

1379
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:47,057
and then rip up the constitution in
front of the world's media.

1380
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:48,157
Piece of cake.

1381
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:04,779
Hello, Lancaster!

1382
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,057
I don't understand
what has happened.

1383
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:17,222
My calculations
were very precise.

1384
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:19,866
If you lose enough weight,
then the zipline will work.

1385
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,629
Do you have anything
in your pockets'?

1386
01:19:21,724 --> 01:19:23,397
Let me check,

1387
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:27,568
What is that?

1388
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,938
It's Vita Coco water,

1389
01:19:29,565 --> 01:19:31,067
Why do you have
Vita Coco water'?

1390
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,807
Because it has
as much potassium as three bananas,

1391
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:35,472
The line is
still too heavy,

1392
01:19:35,571 --> 01:19:37,983
ls there anything else in your pockets
that could be weighing you down'?

1393
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:42,819
You're kidding. So then why did
you bring three bananas?

1394
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:46,552
Because I don't trust the
advertising. I'm naturally suspicious,

1395
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:49,652
ls there anything else you're
carrying? You're still too heavy,

1396
01:19:49,752 --> 01:19:50,890
Just this.

1397
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:53,825
What is that, a brick?

1398
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:56,334
All this time you've had a
brick? Why do you have that?

1399
01:19:56,425 --> 01:19:58,336
Well, to balance out
the weight from the other one

1400
01:19:58,427 --> 01:19:59,667
You have two bricks'?

1401
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:00,797
Yes!

1402
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:02,398
Throw them down
immediately!

1403
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:09,415
<i>Oh, my God!
There's a little goat eating the wire!</i>

1404
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:14,284
You need to lose
weight immediately!

1405
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:17,250
My pockets are empty.
Icould poo.

1406
01:20:17,613 --> 01:20:19,183
That won't be enough
to make a difference.

1407
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:21,818
Yes, it will.
I haven't gone since Wadiya.

1408
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,523
Losing power
has stopped me up like a cork,

1409
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:25,928
Hurry!

1410
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,594
Come on, Supreme Leader!
Make it rain! Make it rain!

1411
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,435
It's out!
And it's pointy!

1412
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:34,770
Somebody stop that man!

1413
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:37,633
Yes!

1414
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:40,173
What'? No, no, no, no!

1415
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:41,970
No, no, no!

1416
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:07,798
Supreme Leader!

1417
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,339
Get out of here
before Tamir kills you.

1418
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,173
Who is Tamil'?

1419
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:16,982
Tamirm

1420
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,747
The bald bastard
who did all these terrible things to us!

1421
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,249
I thought
his name was Dennis,

1422
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:28,488
Haw would you
even make that leap? Tamirto Dennis?

1423
01:21:29,685 --> 01:21:31,687
- Go on, get out! Get out!
- Come on, Monlzi!

1424
01:21:31,754 --> 01:21:32,755
Quick!

1425
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,527
Just jump.
It's not that far.

1426
01:21:38,694 --> 01:21:39,934
Efawad h

1427
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:41,701
It is almost time.

1428
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:46,877
I like goats,

1429
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:50,516
I am very stupid,

1430
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:54,547
<i>This is
an historic moment.</i>

1431
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:57,454
<i>Admiral General
Aladeen of Wadiya</i>

1432
01:21:57,546 --> 01:21:59,048
<i>is going to be signing</i>

1433
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:02,789
the first democratic
constitution in the history of his nation,

1434
01:22:02,885 --> 01:22:06,856
<i>Across the globe,
people are glued to their television sets.</i>

1435
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,528
<i>The people of Wadiya
are celebrating</i>

1436
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,435
<i>what will be
a new chapter in their country.</i>

1437
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:16,209
<i>Just moments away now
from putting his signature</i>

1438
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,643
<i>on the first
democratic constitution.</i>

1439
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:22,245
<i>That's Tamir Mafraad,
Aladeen's trusted advisor,</i>

1440
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:25,308
<i>sharing a lighthearted moment with
Chinese businessman, Xiang Lao.</i>

1441
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,284
<i>Any thoughts on
what they might be saying, Mike?</i>

1442
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:30,255
I thought I made out
the words "Harvey Keitel,"

1443
01:22:32,815 --> 01:22:34,453
<i>Don't know
what that meant.</i>

1444
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:37,292
Maybe they shared
a hot dog together, I'm thinking?

1445
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:41,766
That would make sense. He's wiping the
mustard off his face and chest.

1446
01:22:41,824 --> 01:22:43,132
Excuse me!

1447
01:22:43,225 --> 01:22:44,670
You have to let me in.
You don't understand.

1448
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,433
He's trying to
stop the signing!

1449
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:48,065
Tamir is now speaking,

1450
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,131
Today,

1451
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:51,607
we begin a new era,

1452
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:55,172
<i>Wadiya will be
open to the world.</i>

1453
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,840
Open to the future.

1454
01:22:56,939 --> 01:22:58,441
And open for business.

1455
01:22:59,942 --> 01:23:03,355
The document is
ready to be signed, Supreme Leader,

1456
01:23:11,954 --> 01:23:14,696
What are you doing?
This man is an imposter!

1457
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:19,261
No! This traitor tried to kill me
and had my beard removed!

1458
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,535
Look!

1459
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:24,042
Arrest the viper Tamir!

1460
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:25,839
<i>And now in another</i>

1461
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:29,541
amazing turn of events,
Tamir Mafraad is being taken away.

1462
01:23:29,638 --> 01:23:32,175
This constitution

1463
01:23:32,274 --> 01:23:34,948
is nothing
but a license for oil companies

1464
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,514
and foreign interests
to destroy my beloved Wadiya!

1465
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:42,289
Wadiya will remain
a dictatorship!

1466
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,404
Oh, be quiet.

1467
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:56,799
Why are you guys
so anti dictators?

1468
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:59,876
Imagine if America
was a dictatorship.

1469
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:04,479
You could let 1% of the people
have all the nation's wealth.

1470
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:06,251
You could help
your rich friends

1471
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:08,878
get richer by
cutting their taxes

1472
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:12,220
and bailing them out
when they gamble and lose.

1473
01:24:12,681 --> 01:24:16,993
You could ignore the needs of the poor
for health care and education.

1474
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,725
Your media
would appear free

1475
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:22,927
but would secretly be controlled
by one person and his family.

1476
01:24:23,025 --> 01:24:27,269
You could wiretap phones,
you could torture foreign prisoners,

1477
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:29,535
You could have
rigged elections.

1478
01:24:29,598 --> 01:24:31,703
You could lie about
why you go to war.

1479
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,043
You could fill your prisons

1480
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:37,743
with one particular racial group
and no one would complain!

1481
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:41,452
You could use the media
to scare the people

1482
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:45,457
into supporting policies
that are against their interests.

1483
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:48,926
I know this is hard
for you Americans to imagine,

1484
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:50,963
but please try.

1485
01:24:51,053 --> 01:24:53,294
I will tell you
what democracy is!

1486
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:55,861
Democracy is the worst!

1487
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,871
Endless talking
and listening to every stupid opinion!

1488
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,032
And everybody's
vote counts,

1489
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:04,771
no matter how
crippled or black or female they are,

1490
01:25:05,701 --> 01:25:07,078
Democracy

1491
01:25:13,809 --> 01:25:15,117
Democracy

1492
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:20,620
has hairy armpits
and could lose five pounds,

1493
01:25:21,817 --> 01:25:25,128
Democracy looks like
a midget in a chemo wig,

1494
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:29,935
Democracy, your mother
called the other day

1495
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:31,162
and I forgot to
give you the message,

1496
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:35,400
It was something very important
about your grandmother.

1497
01:25:37,099 --> 01:25:39,739
Democracy kisses you
because she wants to,

1498
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:43,681
not because her father
is in the next room chained to a radiator

1499
01:25:43,772 --> 01:25:45,911
with electrodes
attached to his nipples.

1500
01:25:46,742 --> 01:25:51,088
Democracy is flawed!
She is not perfect!

1501
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:53,249
But democracy,

1502
01:25:56,785 --> 01:25:57,786
I love you.

1503
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,992
And that is
why I call for real democracy!

1504
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,865
A real constitution!

1505
01:26:03,959 --> 01:26:05,939
And real elections
in Wadiya!

1506
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:14,536
Oh, no!

1507
01:26:15,437 --> 01:26:16,609
Come on!

1508
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:26,652
Democracy,
I will make you one of my wives.

1509
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:30,162
Okay, only wife.
We'll vote on it.

1510
01:26:30,786 --> 01:26:32,697
I'll shave
my armpits for you.

1511
01:26:32,788 --> 01:26:34,859
Praise be to the Creator!

1512
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:37,368
And please stop using
that organic deodorant,

1513
01:26:37,459 --> 01:26:39,666
You could gas the Kurds
with that stench.

1514
01:27:06,822 --> 01:27:08,733
You died
protecting me, Efawadh,

1515
01:27:09,491 --> 01:27:10,492
Hello!

1516
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:11,760
You are alive?

1517
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:14,940
Of course!
It is my job to be shot in the head.

1518
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,511
- Is he okay'?
- He's fine.

1519
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:23,175
Luckily the bullet
hit him in the brain.

1520
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:26,115
So,

1521
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:28,611
what now'?

1522
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:32,255
I return to Wadiya
to participate in fair elections.

1523
01:27:44,226 --> 01:27:47,764
Let's now look back
at the wonderful events of the past year.

1524
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:50,639
<i>After Wadiya's
first free elections,</i>

1525
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:53,713
<i>President Prime Minister
Admiral General Aladeen</i>

1526
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:56,375
<i>won 98.8% of the vote.</i>

1527
01:27:58,907 --> 01:28:02,480
<i>But the þig story today is the
marriage of President Prime Minister</i>

1528
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:06,320
<i>Admiral Gene-ralAIadeen
and his new bride, Zoey.</i>

1529
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:13,225
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1530
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:25,271
Are you okay, my love'?
What did you step on'?

1531
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:26,641
Oh, yes! No, no.

1532
01:28:26,735 --> 01:28:30,410
It's my people's tradition.
We always smash a glass at weddings,

1533
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:32,315
- I'm Jewish!
- What?

1534
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:33,681
<i>Maze! to v!</i>

1535
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:39,750
Are you okay'?

1536
01:28:40,749 --> 01:28:43,423
That's fine.
I don't mind. it's great!

1537
01:28:43,852 --> 01:28:45,593
Come here, my love.

1538
01:29:05,307 --> 01:29:07,184
Jachnoon, President
Prime Minister Aladeen.

1539
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:10,552
Jachnoon. Nadal. I have to be back
at the palace in an hour.

1540
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:12,955
Zoey thinks I'm at yoga.

1541
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:14,349
I have great news,

1542
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:17,225
We are just days
away from testing the new missiles.

1543
01:29:17,319 --> 01:29:19,299
I have re-engineered
the oxidizing ducts

1544
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,833
and the payload
delivery systems,

1545
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:25,634
But you'll be happy to know,
the missile is now pointy!

1546
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:28,842
Who cares if it's pointy'?

1547
01:29:28,897 --> 01:29:30,069
What?

1548
01:29:30,565 --> 01:29:32,875
You do.
You care if it's pointy,

1549
01:29:32,968 --> 01:29:34,641
Why would I care
about such a trivial detail?

1550
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,979
Are you serious?
Are you serious right now?

1551
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:38,039
Of course I'm serious,

1552
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:39,584
That's why you
had me executed!

1553
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:42,985
The shape of the missile has nothing to
do with the payload delivery.

1554
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:45,490
That's what I said!
That's what I said the first time!

1555
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:46,992
No, that's what I said,
and you went crazy.

1556
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:49,255
No! You said
Professor Popeye this.

1557
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:51,192
Professor Popeye
is a cartoon.

1558
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:52,559
No, I know this!

1559
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:00,399
So, we're opening
300 Women's Centers,

1560
01:30:00,662 --> 01:30:04,576
but I'm going to have to take a
break for a little bit because

1561
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:06,610
I'm pregnant.

1562
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:07,873
What?

1563
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:14,076
Are you having a boy
or an abortion?

1564
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:38,702
Hello, gentlemen,
How you doin“?

1565
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:40,303
Are you guys friends
of the deceased?

1566
01:30:40,402 --> 01:30:43,212
Do you want me to say this
in front of his widow?

1567
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,306
I was his lover.

1568
01:30:44,406 --> 01:30:45,908
No. That is
not true.

1569
01:30:46,308 --> 01:30:48,310
I saw him perform
with the Globetrotters.

1570
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:50,913
I thought
he was outstanding. I befriended him.

1571
01:30:50,979 --> 01:30:53,118
No, it's
a different person.

1572
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:56,559
His message
of don't worry and being happy

1573
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:57,790
was so powerful.

1574
01:30:57,886 --> 01:31:00,127
No, this is
Bobby McFerrin. I told you this outside,

1575
01:31:00,221 --> 01:31:02,462
Whatever the scandal
you went through,

1576
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:04,400
you're still
the best golfer in the world,

1577
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,631
Let's go.

1578
01:31:07,162 --> 01:31:08,573
O-M-G.

1579
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,008
Oh, my God.

1580
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:15,175
<i>Oh'</i>

1581
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,119
Zoe?

1582
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:30,823
That's some good head!

1583
01:31:33,088 --> 01:31:35,193
That is called payback
and it feels so good!

1584
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:37,600
How did it feel for you'?
How did it feel for you?

1585
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:39,468
I prefer it with goats,

1586
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,697
Where is
the Supreme Leader?

1587
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:42,797
No, no.

1588
01:31:42,864 --> 01:31:45,310
Now that is
called payback!

1589
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,843
Oh, great!

1590
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:55,311
Don't touch it,
Don't touch it,

1591
01:31:55,777 --> 01:31:57,120
You don't have
to touch it.

1592
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:58,213
<i>Sorry. I was...</i>

1593
01:31:58,313 --> 01:32:00,156
Just give us
We don't...
Just give me
a couple of millimeters to myself,
