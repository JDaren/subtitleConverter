Subtitle Converter
==================

This is a java framework for processing subtitle formats and converting them into other formats.

So far the formats supported are EBU's STL, .SCC, .ASS/.SSA .SRT and a subset of W3C's TTML 1.0

The whole project is under licensed under MIT so it can be used freely. Do not hesitate to contact me if this project or I can be of assistance.

You can find the software working online at: TO BE DETERMINED

This work was done as part of my bachelor's thesis for the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.
